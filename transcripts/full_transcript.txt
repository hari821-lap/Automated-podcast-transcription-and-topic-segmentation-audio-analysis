hello everyone welcome to your game live podcast it is friday february twenty first nice phonetic others and are in their yeah but that was an a really stringent it here

so we started doing it again yet and we have had our ebbs and flows of personnel ah and and we i think have a good number in a good chemistry and we're back we weathered the storms get of our own laziness and we made it all the way to one hundred episode well that's it

if you yes and if you look at an attorney did the she carried throughout the last of us i know she has it in the second section oh only she she has it in the interwar part in general might have had little joke book to yeah okay maybe she does yeah never go back and check yeah yeah right right this is a have to go back and check sort of thing and but it's

you know it's it's it's kind of a it's a it's a fairly big moment for the character oh yeah yeah i'm and and really cool that they decided to do that and your he said that they it just kind of came up naturally so when they did the comic he and of neil and faith that a bunch of interviews about it when they are talking about the relationship between them and and one of them said that you know

riley's really are l he's really attracted to riley they just meant sort of in the way that you know younger people kind of hero worship older people a little bit but you know that he said he started thinking and it grew and this bigger idea and then became this more fully realize thing but it's cool i mean the a on a lot of levels i think it provides a sort of experience that is so rare

you know to be able to play like as young teenage girls you know relating to each a to play as a a girl it all a teenage girl at all a teenage girl who spends the entire game you know relating to another teenage girl you know and then and also i don't know exactly how to categorize it if it's you know gay or bisexual or if you know it even needs to have a label that way

that i mean it's either is really cool that they introduce that element into it to yeah i mean it's it takes a takes one game like that to make you go oh cheese that this experiences doesn't exist in this medium outside of like this and you know to other things that i could name right and soda and and especially with see it at home in a game that

is sort of lot it as like that we know one of the best games of last year and sold mean a bolo to copies you know that's that's pretty cool well and ends you know i i also mentioned that to him and he you know he he said something similar that it's too bad that there aren't more experiences like this read that so often for you naughty dog has a little more

the only way to make it sound decisions about this yet of stuff but that at a lot of studios it's very precedent driven in on this happens is this isn't just games it's movies it's comics it's a lot of other media where you know in order to do something you you need to be able to look at something else and say it worked before you know and not been able to do that makes a lot more risky so

you know if if this is successful than said that are than other games can say will look at left behind yeah yeah well okay all of that part i i i was i and i really thought it was it was so well put together i'm the only thing and we were having a discussion about this last only thing the kind of sticks in my craw is that

everything was great up until the very very and where i found myself in another one of those forced combat situations which is the thing that i like the least about the last of us everything up prior to that point i was able to stealth my way through the

combat situations and i felt i still maintain that still thing my way through last of us combat sequences is more thrilling and fun and interesting for me then having to shoot my way through them which to me is

we're going shut down after yeah we're done that's it that's hundred is probably ninety nine too many so i'm so anyway you are absolutely right it this episode one hundred and here we are swung today is gala show some extravaganza hundredth anniversary of game wife we started as a

it it's it's either it somewhere between boring and frustrating it's it's never just that amount of fun for me especially compared to stuffing so i loved sneaking by the infected again i thought the i think that they're the way that they they they create the sense of tension with with audio

and and everything is still sort of pitch perfect and then it was after the kiss so that sort of the technical climax of the whole thing had already happened and now i was just forced into this combat situation just to see the end which was in the end was not even after all that the ending was not even as good as what had happened

before i mean it was the ending was sort of a pro forma ending you know what i mean like v the the great great stuff the really interesting the big twist that had already kind of occurred saw was just sort of like i felt like i was having a slog my way through again this comment see when said he didn't want to do and they did something that i just i almost never do which they got so for us

they did that i kicked it down from normal that easy then i just i just sort of easy combat it my way through it and is relied on the fact that everything would be weaker and stupid her yeah i mean going through the game i i thought of you chris not because i know i knew i'd i remembered you talking about your frustrations with you know what you felt for combat in the previous one

you don't and partly i think this is because again like your plane is ellie you're playing as a character that isn't as strong in hand to hand but you really did give you that option to still throughout the game which i thought was cool arm and you know i think for the final confrontation and news is also something that came up with the interview although ended up cutting it out for space which was that i'm here

intended it to sort of be this climactic thing where he wanted her to have to fight for jolla the because of the very end you know you have joelle kind of the injured droll locked up in this sort of area and them all and these guys are trying to open it and if you don't engage with them for long enough the actually open the lock and they get in and it's game over

you know so it it forces you to move forward and keep fighting them and that was sort of the idea that you have to engage in you have to fight and that also that a lot of what that represents you know comes from the scenes with riley to or she had a friend that she lost statue and that that that's and for mean so much

the you know urgency that alleys feeling that in a she doesn't wanna lose someone again and so like and so she has to fight that said i see where you're coming from and it was difficult and editor it if it if i hadn't been coming out of having just like gone through last of us and been kind of frustrated with what i felt was an imbalance you know like he didn't feel

it was a game where you could choose how you went through it and then only sometimes you had to kill everyone it felt like it was a game where you could choose how to go through it sometimes but most of the time you just had to kill everybody and so when it when it happened again i was at all this again now so there was probably

the a little bit of bias going in basically but but yeah i mean it was it was yeah it was the one it was the one sort of you know kind of niggling complaint that i still that i still had about it but otherwise again it's it's it's really it's it's crazy what they decided to do with this piece of dlc and how well they did

small playing card company in kyoto japan or watches were that fl of the ball i'm we are going to talk about video games that we have been playing the number of them and and also i went to the the dice some it as as many of you may okay probably mention

oh i think at this point we should probably cut out to that that that that pre recorded segment that i mentioned which is to say that i went to the that the dice some it out in las vegas couple weeks ago i spoke with a fair few people let's see who's in there these yeah eugene

this who was the winner of the pioneer ward i introduce all of these things in this is fun segment thirty three so don't worry and also a palmer lucky i'm child genius and head of had a vakalis i like that he's gone from from adam for some reason boy genius

the shot like sometimes the younger male specimen button you're going back in time if you eat trade baby a his point i've weighed all the possible word choices and pick the one that's funny funniest so here we go here are a variety of interviews from the dice red carpet

one of the great things about this year's dice is that i finally got to meet a lot of the in the game creators who made some of my favorite games of the last year i and i actually got to speak with steve gainer creator have gone home for a little bit on the red carpet you have you have any regrets do have anything like oh gee i wish the

the gun that i'm lucky the feel like there's going big i feel like i wish we got married and i wish you hadn't done it that way or this way i mean we're very lucky to not a very big reviews in the middle cerebral just stuff out and replace it or anything you go is which

our now that more detail another thing they thought it would have been so far as like a good that's great movie i would say i feel like we have anything we usually don't looked all over and i can't find the sniper right is the sniper we're going to end this interview here

after i spoke with steve i actually found myself face to face with about one but two indie game creators of who's games i play over the last year and had just loved right in who made the stanley parable and he was walking down the red carpet with lucas pope who made papers please which was why

the game of the year and twenty thirteen and i was really excited to talk to the both from mother had no idea what to say so enjoy this this stammering awkward interview it's it's great if they were both good sports and i was very nice to meet the both of them so maybe is it

to destroy gone home right just not going out of the park the idea is to destroy video row right of course i didn't that's what we're here to do to make sure everyone else would agree with you agree to throw videogame yeah you get right bit but it but in all seriousness i am i'm big fans of love both your guys works got to play

know became vice year but really he had a really fantastic i don't actually know what you saying i pretty much just wanted to say those are really good video cameras that requires a really good thank you very much try hard that it's going to be all right i know i seriously have i have nothing i'm just standing there going like keynes if they're so good

and if the day summit you get to go into the red carpet and have very brief interviews with people from the video game world and dumb and then i saw i saw i did that i did that night i spoke with people for like two seconds each and they took the most interesting parts and i edited them all together into a seamless

the like chris farley before they even big the chris farley interview and you like intervene paul mccartney i remember the beatles you agree with your family you know our totes that's a cool country i think when we get down to it that's that's what interviews really are we here to kind of like look each other in the eyes little bit worried

right now and then move on our way i mean i guess are you going to be inspired going to benefit from this interview we're going to put this on our podcast real yeah hug yeah yeah oh gosh thanks for listening to everyone on me happy prison the rest of my right do you want to say something nice about him and he can say something nice about you

i know i get big i'm going to get out there's there's i'm sure there's something about are you got a i i've known a lot of people in my life lucas is about i was going to say one of the people like let's just say

you're not the works here not the worst that every have any person i've ever had a that works person i've ever met carpet i'd have i'd sell out a this is i'd i didn't know that that all with the end of the scale i didn't know i would be receiving a very great lot of scale of one the baby he's like a baby

right and i'll take the second place that i spoke with rich hill him and now he is the original creator of john madden football and he's currently chief creative officer an electronic arts and i asked him you know as somebody who spent so much time in the video game the

what should we be watching for in the near future in his answer was very unexpected but if you think about it it actually makes a whole lot of sense if i were going to take my guard horses and you're going to like my got my dark horse is like word gaming platform be like if it was on a car think about all the time

that american spend it on what are the primary time periods we don't currently have what i came out what i thought the most interesting thing it's vs was the emergence of a car i apply for okay why community bit more about that emerged cars gaming platform because my up my photos always been like going to get myself in trouble you're going good it's going to take you about tremendous there's like oh no

that what the answer is stop thinking district terms like it's a video cards all right think in terms of how you interact with a car being part of a larger game to interact with know how that could change your behavior in positive ways and eighty or better yet it's awesome thank you very much i mixed got to speak with to

absolute game industry legends eugene jarvis us the creator of robo tron and smashed tv and he was being given that the dice pioneer award that night and he was there out with marked her male who was absolutely a video game industry mainstay he's a senior creative director now at zynga but he started programming atari twenty six hundred

ames are he created and be a jam when he was at midway swimming he's just been a fixture in the game industry and are we got to talking about some pretty fun stuff sells and him you're getting a pioneer word but i would who would be your hit for a for a pioneer or who is your who's your favorite person who is kind of

segment which we will dump in the middle of the show is gonna be like brian williams wrapping the news is you can be one of those know ashes of of know it's what they actually said okay let's in the in that's unfortunate yeah i'm so we'll see if you don't like it i promise to never do it again for at least another year so about them ah yes

i mean i gotta go with no english out here yet i mean he almost singlehandedly created the arcade research and find a way that was be a video game and even all is this power of his disciples

that's why some what what's your favorite eugene job name is robert try robot tron lot less than the game that brought me into williams electronics the time to work with you and to this day that most amazing thing about that is that it has two hundred fifty five

you can set that game up in some room and it still holds up those numbers today the same pacing that modern games have difficulty levels the challenge it still resonates today it's incredible to me i loved i was playing smash tv terrible horrible but i love

the what you want to toaster you want to be see our i love the chin see you've just murdered fifty people say when a pc our nature of and it was so funny yeah that was the only know what's around trying to scare oh that was as i was as to get so much fun with a pig kind of

fired by running man and robot and the horse power like that the hardware i had so much worse by for know that you know we put out one grant then another one another one another and then more lot more to shop yeah it just kept on going over and over and over the top any because the hardware allowed to it is by pilot said it's pets

i think slug guys opponent palmer lucky who is the twenty one year old founder of akio us the vr company was also on the dice red carpet because he was a presenter the awards and dumb we got to talking about you know what was going to happen with virtual

reality and how i'd developers our going to support virtual reality and our were that sport was gonna come from and you know he made a very interesting point about i'm in be a game developers really kind of they're they're being grassroots support for virtual reality as opposed he brought the counter example

the sort of failed push up for stereo stopping the read the gaming so here's that part of that conversation male rape and like in video thirty one a game developers and helping them make their found that really compatible was some they were trying to do on their own virtual reality on the other hand is going to put from completely the opposite direction it has been consumed

an indie developer saying we want to make virtual reality games we want vr games that the game or think we want to play those vr games and then you're actually seeing a lot of the aaa started to follow them after there's already lot of your contact the only other thing that i can think of that be kind of to quibble would be the mobile games industry where it was a lot of a who got it and

before the aaa vr really is being pushed by indie game developers and replace what's your favorite crazy archaeologists like demo so far that somebody there there's so many crazy ones yet job be going elephants is really good with would simply going to do you play as

so which we switch what to talk about first time the titan fall beta just ended that was a thing that it was it was head of people were really excited about that people were excited there is a lot of rapturous tweeting and writing about it was yeah you played it i played i played it and what did you think about why i was going to ask you the same thing

the pentagon abstract cartoon world then you swing your trunk around to smash things in this crazy as trip girl it's something else and we're back live in the studio that was awesome wasn't a grass many arsenic yeah i'm going to has we haven't heard it maybe you haven't heard it

i wasn't really carefully while we made that at it is yeah see that and i have to say high quality stuff so as we have a couple more video games we can talk about i want to okay i want to talk about jazz punk going around about octo dad last we talked about not talk about after that okay so i mean there's there was octo dad and yeah

the wearing and your game of of february your great indie experience that really have to have is jasmine it is very hard to describe jazz punk it was a first person puzzle adventure game the but the everything is super heavily stylize it is a world

that is like i'd i know it's it's like themed around retro computers i guess kind of i'm it's it it is deliberately difficult to put into words because it is such an insane sort of experience

but you are a secret agent who was sent on various missions but but to say that is to make it sound mundane and which really isn't it is a it is in absurd comedy adventure and so all of the characters look like icons on men's bathroom doors for some

than except for like the robots which for some reason don't you you just you just go through this this variety of increasingly weird scenarios have like here in the of to infiltrate the soviet consulate you have do i the bus into a sushi restaurant and and get something from a that double

and who have to you you end up getting sent to a resort hotel and and all kinds of crazy things happen but it it's dumb it's it is great humor in that everything that happens is unexpected you really if you think you know what's gonna happen when you opt to someone and talk to

you don't because the game really delights in the setting you up to think that your actions are going to have a certain ah effect arm as we sort of expect out a video games and then making those actions have income

wheatley different effect than the one that you expected and by virtue of subverting your expectations we find really some of the best like physical humor i'm that i have ever kind of experienced in a video game the writing is the writing is solid

it's it it says that it's inspired by the naked gun and things of that nature i'm and and you can sort of see that i'm but it is really be like animated physical humor of the game that makes it as good as it is

sure what did you think about it should a well i you know it's certainly a a game that i've been looking forward to it to has if you are unfamiliar with it's lineage this is the first came from respond entertainment which was founded by two of the departed infinity ward founders i believe and and staff

and i could describe jokes to you but i feel like if i described them to you they wouldn't sound as funny as they are and then i'd spoil the joke so i'd with nothing else to say about it jazz punk has been one of my favorite favorite

the experiences of two thousand and fourteen so i'm definitely looking for all month and a half you got do we all the album ninety days of twenty fourteen thus far it has been really good you should you should definitely check it out and then by no laura has one more she was talk about but i do i even have one more one time when we are you

right we thought about that one too and i do want to say that the new humble bundle is joe had a the other day and there are some great stuff anti chamber isn't there ah guacamole gold edition is in there are dustin a tail is in there and a few others but it's a pretty stellar pack so if you if you do not likes to it's

stay up with the humble bundle announcements that's a good one take out for sure all i my turn you have an idea so i'd want to take a second term before you i appreciate that we're going around the room i'm holding the talking stick ah there's there's another game that i have played for some time over less

week or so called the dongen grandpa i believe the subtitle is trigger happy havoc know which is not a name that makes any that unlike out of title at all so it's kind of it's it's kind of a little bit of battle royale meets phoenix wright with a tiny splash of a persona

that sounds weird it's very very basic cocktail their fathers there is a logo on on the premises the you are young high school soon you're not really exceptional maybe or in every man had a guy were you get selected to go to the super elite high school and you're so psyched because really give i go to high school for some reason it's going to make him set for life

because that's how the say school also i say they start over and i can be any i wanna be know what like a downloadable game for the playstation veto right yes is of yes so but the ideas everyone else at the school is an ultimate something where it's like the ultimate baseball player like the ultimate programmer like for some reason is the ultimate fashion model they put her into okay

these wrestling icon ultimate warrior that the now there is there's an ultimate hacksaw jim duggan is no good well he was the ultimate wielder of a to buy for and that's why there's an ultimate fighter who is oh a woman who has a more masculine to her like she's yeah she's like for some reason aesthetically everyone else it's a certain way and she looks like a street fair character okay funnier

this is just roll with it anyway so you show up there but when you arrive before you even meet anyone things go kind of swirly and then you wake up and you know you lift your head to head above the desk and then you're in the school but things are kind of weird and you realize that their metal sheets overall the windows i knew you know we kind of meet the other students with their

many editors fifteen of you in total and then this crazy panda bear robot jumps up and announced early wonders as his name is monique kuma you will grow to love flesh hate him he's your headmaster and he is a mechanical banda and that's just what it is or been it is roll with it and william acid trip into showbiz pizza it's know it's i i i

with many of the and that i old infinity ward people who followed them out of activision yeah so as well as they went from activision than started responded yea this was basically the return of the team that turned call of duty into the juggernaut that it is today i mean a respond we should point out as an independent

the recommend altering your your my you know everything that's what that sounds like yeah no noted i'm not saying it sounds like someone drops a massive before you guys ice ice and really not recommend that so he informs all of you that your new trapped in the high school for the rest your life not only that but there's another way out and that's if you kill somebody

in the school just one person that were oh it may be gets a little more complicated as time goes on our that's all that i'll say the stakes get higher and higher and he just becomes this character that's just like this massive murder troll it's constantly trying to do things to like make you kill each other about the who blackmail yeah

revealed terrible secrets or offer you money from nightmare if but in between that you get to like spend time and forge relationships with people on who loner who you are to care or have to determine if like and then there's that paranoia about you know if are they trying to kill me right on is a ayers the are these it has multiple its notes ai

that are there the gameplay mechanics here so for the most part it either different rooms and ever so basically mom's don't let you know some murders occur and other one a murderer at her offer for the most part you get like free time and then it's just a meeting people and getting the more you interact with a specific person the closer you get in the more you learn their personal story okay i would

sighs and you had is from them that will be useful useful later but i advise if you can figure out who's gonna die you want to talk to them and get their story and abilities before they don't will but then once the death occurs then you enter an investigation state are you go round of the different rooms and collapse certain clues and once you've collected all the clues i mean you really can try to piece it together on your own

but then you are a trial sequence which is sort of the phoenix wright is for each death that occurs in the game yes these other two phases the and the law and order that happen no gonna your these investigation and then you go to the trial and if you screw up the trial everyone dies oh words yes so guava never made that yeah it's it's it's er it's like

battle battle royale on order and so it mother in law and yeah and there's like up some puzzle sequences that happen during the trial seems that i personally find a little bit annoying but it's really hard to lose a senator who did it kind of roles itself out but it is interesting in kind of trying to piece it together and and go

through this entire process and then i mean there is a bigger mystery you know at what a why are you second this weird high school at why how like isn't aren't the police can to help you are sir you know some up with this parent is there something else more going on ah that a that leads me to think there might be something more going on yeah there might be and to once you've won the game sharply also

there's up the will there's another mode called school mode which is extra bizarre because it's it takes out a whole of the murder and slip what have you just hung out with everybody over and but then there's this whole other gameplay element that they make you do were like you're just allocating people to like different tasks and like trying to like build like different mona koumas

like but other than that you're just like hang out with each other and little bring the nail on the pandora yet he had a result post game content your own army i think it's a separate mode can just play on outlook and easy as his whole other mechanism but the weird thing about it is if you just like they didn't i think it really change a lot of dialogue sleeve entire front of like yeah there's no murder

the is not like an ea of is not engage partner but it was published by the gate this particular game is published by electronic arts yes yeah thank you that is that is a good distinction make did you do you think that's an overstatement about their role in called duties blockbuster ness as far as a multi player title

here but like some people just might talk about murdering each other murdering you are what i'm just ignore it you know is just that didn't happen right right right is a sort of refurbishing riyadh but than the it's it's or if any of that sounds interesting to you you will enjoy this game the rules are you have williams yeah williamsburg made a video game it might be somewhat like this it school

as put it explicitly in which people talk about murder but it never happened now that the never cut up methods yeah on a game now yeah ah ah that's cool yeah i guess you drove my game to close this out his arm a dog is called it's actually called weapon shop day or must say which is

anyway i think the a tradition now of just not translating the japanese titles of your of your video style ah i'm it is it is one of the games level five the guys who did professor layton and various other video games ah produced

two cartridges for the three yes japan called guild zero one and guild zero two and they were collections of smaller games that were done by a variety of designers and all of these games are actually available on the the downloadable he shot that the only way to get them for the three vs in america in this was the will of the this

the one that was lagging behind our because it is a extremely text heavy game and it just took them while to to translate it on the premise is that a role playing game is going on around you and you are a guy who runs an item shop and so various heroes who are trying to defeat the

lord or whatever it is they're trying to do come to you to my weapon oh cool yeah and so i love this is a is a rhythm game also because the way you forged the weapons is there is a proper the rapper style call and response where it taps out to be and then you have to tap on the the glowing hot metal on the be

but then also in the correct places on the weapon to carve out or for your pound out the weapon that you're trying to make yeah i'm sorry i am i alone am flashing back i'd buy may be completely misremembering this but ah some of the craft progressions er sku progressions and feeble

worked somewhat similarly never played it never i couldn't tell you okay now i'm and i've only played about an hour of this and so far what has happened is people have from into the shop they said i need such and such weapon and like okay and make it for them then there's little mini game or you disrupt the silas on at the polish it up before you handed out and you this rent them

and so what it starts doing is it says okay pay item shock i what quest should i take and so you you you look at this guy's level you look at the various quests he could embark upon and you're looking at the weapons that you have to rent him then you're making a determination of what quest i'm going to send him out on because of the go out in the questions

di di don't get paid so you're really trying to match up with a requests there is a twitter like system in the game so it when they go out on their quests i'm vey it's called i'm grind casting and it is explained away in a completely ridiculous manner but basic

infinity ward is she kind of it was cod for wasn't it that really became the first oh yeah same multiplayer css it was immune it was call of duty modern for modern warfare that took the the emerging call of duty siri could never call of duty to was like popular yeah

the thing to say as they all tweet while they're on their quest on there cause i'm an medieval class yeah and so they are tweeting with hash and everything slashed exits pretty funny when they're doing stuff so you can keep an eye on what they're doing in their outside the shop and the the the the the grind caster the twitter feed it just runs

that's a even when you're in the rhythm games like you can see you can keep up with the the feed to see how they're doing or you could just jump into it and sort of scroll through it and then we know if they survive they come back and they return the weapon to you in you eat you get paid and damn if they find anything out there you might get that to like more materials make more weapons

and so far it's it's pretty funny and the gameplay is a is pretty good nice yet not yet to shop at is ie shopper and i am all of the guild games are good to varying degrees i never it the so there's one that's actually by i'm yeah me to know who did vagrant story you know and some of this sort of we

square enix roleplaying games arm and there he did our final fantasy twelve to right so i'm and that is a pretty intense strategy roleplaying type game that i never really got into one that i played all the way through which is really good was called the starship damn murray and it's just a first it is a it is a am

you are the basically the lone survivor on a starship that is sort of adrift in space and you can't get out of your sleeping capsule but you hacked the the the like the cleaning robot system and so you are wheeling robots around in

the first person mode around the ship to accomplish things from york capsule in the in that is really cool i really like ballon yeah so the all the games are are pretty good stride them and a and they're actually all on sale through the of it this weekend and everything except for weapon shop the my say is three dollars a laugh

pretty good so anyway if there are good guy that is the end of new business i say we we call this meeting was closed during this well you been listening to the game live podcast production of us here at wired i have been your host chris color peter ruben and or hudson have been here in the studio with me

the what you are come yell at me on twitter i am at cohen heat and k o b u n h e eighty so feel free to tell me any of your problems i don't necessarily want me to tell you any of your problem right but some of your problems would be okay i ah topic problem on topic problems

immense lara underscore hudson as ellie you are a you de eso an arm and you want to tell me what my problems are yeah cause lord knows i don't get enough of that on the internet as it is on twitter as proven self p r o v and s e l f and if you want to send us a i'm a

the m p three remix of us performing rappers delight you are free to do south always waste any time just center right along think you offer listening to you guys for being here today and we will see you next week poof

the thing i liked if i'm and that yes this is your game live podcast for that particular day and that curricular month arm hello hello everyone i'm we we know that we have had some technical issues with the podcast and three vs weeks and we hope that as you were listening to the

but you know it wasn't it wasn't the the call of duty the world's biggest videogame ever but it was call of duty modern warfare that a reinvented the whole genre remember the whole genre up to that point was world war two who yeah that's their he later robert to some other than my counter strike him and things like that in the right

right right but like the the it was very popular and people were making all these knock offs of like you know of of period pieces yeah i'm in so modern warfare set things in a very near future sort of setting and that was a big shift for call of duty because again the the the this this even the call of duty medal of honor sort of

there was like it it had it's origins in that like you know realistic somewhat realistic you know historical type with a thing but it also took military shooters and brought it to the level of a halo yeah a quaker were we're weren't in so it it yeah basically and so modern warfare harm you know that

really was the thing that kind of like establish not only the the sean or as being the huge sort of world beater that it is now but also that particular time frame in that particular sort of experience i'd also like to point out that i played the single player campaign three times on

three different i just played it and then i'd ramp up the difficult now hide again that at raf of i don't know there was just something about that game i think for whatever reason it just resonate with me also but although the interesting thing here is that titan fall and i did not really this i i think this information was out there but i didn't really realize it until just recently

he doesn't have a campaign rally follows a multiplayer only game in fact we just got the review copies of our plants vs zombies garden warfare also for me i also fry exclusively on x box you know systems and that to we say is a multi player and only x box live gold required

experience which is interesting because i played the the first thing you do with titan fall as you play the tutorial yeah i'm in it walks you through like a sort of a half an hour i'm thing that just teaches you all of the basics of movement in shooting and you know getting into a titan and we know he can do when you doing that which is nice about three times as long as your usual

training tutorial level anyhow studio it's extensive either trivia and i really liked it and i kind of i found myself thinking i wish there was a single player adventure because it's almost they mean it's it's mirrors edgy in terms of me control the have how how fast you run you can double jump you can all while

ron you can jump between walls it's like this actually feels pretty good as a first person ah platform he kind of game but unfortunately that's not reflected in the in how he actual structure the web or far because they are multiplayer necessarily they are they are online is an all online

the player normally game the i'm even know if it's some at the i'm sure this information is out there know if they're split screen i don't know if there is any off that's a good question i don't yeah i don't i don't know either but sure we should look into that we should look at the ah so as far as gameplay goes i'm you know i certainly

now you will agree with us that things have been solved arm and so we appreciate your patience as we work through this hand are your your constant listenership i'm we've been listed a cadre of of audio experts in the office yeah i mean we've we've borrowed mike's we've had outside people come

enjoyed myself i think that what's nice about it is being a more far future let's say version of a know the associate or exert it takes elements of halo in in your kind of super human qualities along the double jump the wall runs you just you feel a lot more like a spartan than you do

you don't military operative on planet earth and because of that ah it it makes the there's also another element of of halo play which is this kind of posts mission extraction so yeah if you're playing the attrition model which is their version of a team deathmatch

the play to a certain point thresholds worth kill threshold once that's done the losing team has to get to an extraction point get picked up and we out in order to get a score bonus branch of the rounds that i played it seemed like from one to three people would make it to the extraction yeah yeah i blunt and what can you can try to shoot them as they're leaving ten years and that is why wanted

leave but we only got blown up once there was once we were up against a team that really had kind of dominated us they knew what they were doing and i got to the drop ship i got to the extraction point all like there were four of the opposite team members they were all in titans and they were all firing on the ship same old

the slate and that ship blue are they took out the whole ship yeah oh i drop ship that's awesome i did not see that have you that i mean but yeah i think you have to like you really have to concentrate heavy weapons fire on it for a while to do it so you bring this up there's there's two really interesting things that are going on here

number one i really like how they they basically store a fight multiplayer matches like typically you know i don't do a whole lot of multiplayer first person shooter ring but like the match starts and you just begin totally there is no reason why you're there you're on the battlefield you're in the middle the battlefield

not even on the battlefield yeah you're in a drop ship what are you think so and most games you start middle the battlefield oh i see in most in than in in other games you know that when when the battle ends everything just freezes and it ends like inflicted the game is over so number one from a cool kind of aesthetic standpoint this game begins with you in a drop ship huge

the out of the drop ship and then you're in and then so there's like a a compelling reason for why this battle was beginning out of nowhere fisher a soldier you're going out of that that's why you're starting this battle now everything's kind of going on around you you fight the battle and then it doesn't just abruptly end it says were you know we're getting killed drops you

come in a and all survivors get to the drop ship in and get out and so then then there's a storyline reason for why the battle is ending that point one point to every single time every single battle but i played i lost i did not win the league during the entire titan for battle

my team never won a battle now of course you know the you might point out that the one constant between every team that i was on was me and that was the second cop who are the bane of other video gamer say there were occasional moments where i was not the worst person i'm so but we never won

in your hands of friends you're trying to fix this year so hopefully this will do the trick yes indeed their problem lost their with there were there was a level problem last week nobody could hear any of us were resolved know you i thought that i i don't thought i just couldn't get the volume high enough on my computer that's that's based i blamed

but i always had a blast because even in defeat there was an element of you couldn't you couldn't win defeat or lose defeat yeah because if you after your defeated manage to run to the drop ship and get yourself onto the drop ship without dying and and blast

staff you get a bunch of you got a boatload of experience points for haven't done that i'm and you feel really good about yourself you actually feel good yeah i'd i'd i did yeah that's absolutely true i've yeah yes there's a big yeah a moment when you get are not as i our i never thought about myself as having lost if i was able to get onto

drop ship and fly oh and also when you get on the drop ship depending on how earlier there you are you have other enemy soldiers coming up and try to take you out while you're in the drops at your you have to basically fire on them from with within from the safety of the drop ship that's her and then there's more so the and then the other quick element to that to that epilogue section is one of the round has been kind of announce

over the have to get to the drop ship if you get killed at that point there's no response let's get killed at the beginning of that epilogue section you just have to sit there and you expect hate and it's so much more frustrating than just being killed and getting kicked out to the lobby yeah because like all these i could be having more fun but after watch other people have fun yeah yeah yeah so a couple

quick note on time for that i enjoyed in particular were ah i like that so there there's kind of a two tiered gameplay you play as a soldier and then you can get an a mac known as a titan and play in the titan each of those has class of so obviously there soldier yeah classes that you can play you can country

the close quarters combat or be an assassin or what have you and then your tightened can also be calibrated two different types of gameplay and i enjoyed that aspect of it finding a titan class that wasn't the exact same play styles my soldier class but then being able to do both being more of a tank as a titan but being more kind of roam around and and

people have silently as a soldier so i enjoyed that kind of melding of play styles and i also really enjoyed some the weaponry in particular there's a smart pistol that you use it has an auto lock feature yeah which makes it feel much more like a primary weapon than any other pistol i've ever used in a younger we i really really appreciated i didn't play enough to

level up enough within the classes to play with scope so i played iron sights only essentially for all the weapons that are you so i can't really speak to the modifications of the weapons which is always a big draw the shooter but there's so many other elements of this game that i don't think that that will be as much of a compelling yea or nay i'm certainly the the kind of acrobatic soup

the hero nature of of the run down as a lot of fun gavel bangs yeah yeah without you i i don't play on a first person shooters having played the titan for beta i don't really see that changing for me like playing it is like oh that's right this is why i don't really play this is just not my genre

but at the same time it really it it was more fun i think that i've ever had with a multiplayer shooter kids because i think that they have correctly reef thought how do we make this fine even if you're dying and how do we make you feel like you are accomplishing something even if

myself yeah exactly see you blame the victim victim now i did imagine at home fast forwarding through the podcast like everything else that anyone else said just trying to get to her own right right laura name address but but but i'd be myself to as the you don't get you to fill us or i'm i'm chris color i am the editor of game like

like it was really great to like after getting blown up in a titan so many times like thirty seconds after i get in there was it was really fun when i was able to stick around in a titan for a little bit longer by judiciously running away and when we know recharging my shields coming back doing some more damage leaving and then you know as if they will ever have you know i sit that

heightened for like a whole minute and and gained a lot of experience points because you know i took out so many things you know while in a titan you know that felt that felt pretty good will was also nice about that that to to play is that ah being in a titan and taking out titans are valued so much more than killing as a so

soldier so you can have people who are kind of really lone wolf he run and gun players and any other team deathmatch setting they might not top the leaderboard if you die a lot but you take out titans and your judicious about the way you play your tongue leaderboard for your team so it's a nice reprioritisation it's a more cooperative feeling deathmatch

style of play un in most other franchises which i enjoyed and we'll see how it realizes the promise of a game like brink when which purported to meld single and multiplayer ah oh yeah and pains and kind of failed miserably i sure did but i think this this is ironed out a lot of those kicks that anybody talk on micro

the ones where you were playing but i'm with the deal is with this because it i mean i don't know if it's people don't want to because they don't need to because of the nature of the game i won because the game really does do a good job of communicating he like what you might want to do right now i'm or i don't know if it's because the x box one doesn't come with a headset well i will say

when i play x called you a ghost on x box one they're certainly people with headsets okay but playing time for i noticed that it was silent so one possibility for that is in the early days of the beta it which may have been press only know they were was always open i think was always open i think there were before they started sin

the out the beta codes to the people who had registered i believe that some members of the press had gotten mumble we're talking like the night before they oh so nevermind then i was gonna say i believe so i was going to say it strikes me that games journalists would be headset it on average less frequently then

gp gamers general populace think they have the headsets i think maybe they decided to not use them mckenna really felt like know nobody was talking to me you know and doubt he was nobody wanted me to use a headset there no one talked about my mom which was weird that was canister india to listen a little about a little bit little bit stuck on center

man but but but but i'm so yeah to forbid and of course the main the the actual game comes out on march eleven so it's not really like we have to wait a whole long time before we can play it again there was kind of sad though because there was the day that it ended i was at work and i was just like oh mediocre humbling tightened fallen and a released like didn't six

i'm that day now point eight vol yep oh i'm so at this point the podcast i believe we should start the spoiler section for lend me heiner the the the dlc for the last of us which you play it and i played in union blake lakers you have not played last of our last of

here at wired and with me in the studio as usual is peter ruben senior editor at wired and lara hudson contributor wired and here we are so on today's podcast what i just want to point out that this is our one hundred episode also true of game live audio

by i've been however police boy he had to edit my interview with neil dreckman the so he's i think aware of when we say i had to chose to i was blessed with the opportunity to i saw the is that up oh now that it is ok here's a regular one and there's an extended one where i talk longer

there is a super cut however deep dive with is the audio oh no no no no it's him as i think the the uncut ones like and are now she's a thousand more were yeah three thousand words versus two thousand where it is actually so there's a short version you can read and then there's a long version yeah if you really want to get a i like talking about some of the more specific things if you know yet if you look for it on the site you'll get a shorter

but in that we link out to their longer the one that no one that neil promoted i think with all on loans which is cool i'm at so yeah at this point if you for some reason played the last of us but haven't played the dlc or otherwise want to keep yourself spoiler free do not listen to this sick

yeah maybe maybe maybe maybe jump forward and and if you haven't played it and you plan to play it you should wait do yourself a favor ago for sure there are you okay well what you jump in yeah ah so we mean you understand basically what happened so i do i think we've discussed little bit of before other basic premise of it

which is that the game takes place at two periods and time at one is sort of after joe gets impaled in into cool yeah it's an inter colder we have people half and the middle of the game so half of it takes place at l his life before she meets job when she's at a military school in boston and half of it takes place

after the period where i'm joe gets injured and before you have that amazing deer hunting sequence you ever really find out like power what happened like how did she save him like how did she mean a deal with everything that happened after that and it sort of jumps back and forth and it's interesting because the portion that you play

ah in her early life there's essentially no combat ah she doesn't you know have any ability to fight and she's not really presented with situations which he has to fight she's in a mall with her friend riley and they've had a falling out but riley's comeback in there they sort of go to the mall to you know kind of you know have a fun experience together and rallies trying to make it up

that you know she kind of an abandoned her as a friend some earlier indistinct point but the other half of it also takes place in the mall all of it yes teenage girls and more yeah but the second half she's you know the ellie that we come to know in the game where she's really kicking butt and taking names and there's a new function

the that it introduced which had almost been completed for the last game but didn't and so when they had more time for the deal see they went back and implemented it which is that you can make the humans and the infected fight each other you can kind of hide and throw a brick and then get them to start taking each other out and just sort of watch the carnage go down which is

very satisfying it's very enjoyable to what am i really had only really happens in like there's there's one sequence in the game in which it's very very scripted in which they want you to do it like you're there you can see that there's humans over here and infected over here and there's all these bricks in front of you you know what the kind of make you do it you throw the brick the infected kill humans

podcast in it's current form our audio engineer surely actually reminded me of this meant she is the one to know because she actually to type in the episode number every time she uploaded and be three and and i had noticed it was coming up and then i totally forgot exactly reminded us of it and then we got into the studio and i totally forgot and then you reminded me of it

pretty pretty decisively the second for me and he was gonna say but i've had that player two different way oh really yeah i think it depends on like where they are and like when you throw it would i thought was cool right leg that it could potentially work out different ways yeah that is that is cool it it said it's dynamic i just i kind of thought that the beaches yeah they did in fact

just devoured the humans because they beat him readied substantially when i played but then it anyway the next encounter after that is definitely a little bit more the infected or sort of the infected or way over here and the humans or maybe a bit more closer in our marcos or they're closer to move on and so

oh it's a little bit more complicated in terms of well what am i do and how are they going to fight each other and they might see me during the fight because i you know we have less of a hiding spot but it was it was cool it was good it was neat to realize oh that's what i get to do now and he also reflects i think you know that i mean this happens any time you play but i think it's an ex

tension of that which is that she's not a melee fighter electoral she's not that big if you go straight out a guy there's a really good chance he's gonna take you out where it so she has to be stealthier and smarter and she sort of has to fight smarter not harder than and is the you know another way to allow her to do that you know going up against i mean granted we understand that she's you know really tough

you know when she's taking out like a dozen guys you know it makes it feel a little more reasonable for that to be happening so that so basically the the the the combat heavy section is that interpol part where joelle is injured and will use gonna go get medicine for him and i'm in of somewhere and

more then the the the prequel part which i mean i think as we mentioned on the the last episode it runs it it it picks up almost immediately where the the graphic novel i'm the last of us american dream isn't ah ends off so you should read if you really want the full experience read the

graphic novel which will take you like a half an hour like right before you play the game yeah and it runs right together or and one night i did the interview with neil drug been created the game he said that he doesn't think they would have done the deal see if they hadn't on the comic i'd say the common the graphic novel or villa from dark horse woman named fate

hicks ah was corroded and and illustrated it and she emil says she pretty much created riley she designed her arm and it's it's so cool in a way that you know it was it came out of this process of making this comic yeah and then then they made the game out of it in there so many elements and in the comic

they also encounter own this video game it's basically a mortal kombat video games like that but they can use mortal kombat so they made of a different one and then so faith me this character called angel knives to serve a like you know a female wolverine x twenty three ish kind of character and one of if not the best sequence in the game

involves them going back to that arcade and actually playing the game actually in air quotes yeah because the cool thing as they start to play the game and it's not working were in their disappointed or says whoa we can play it just close your eyes like cure the buttons she starts narrating were like you know you're at the shaolin temple and yeah

just an on our own andrea who arrived weekend if if if these balloons and the confetti gets in our way between us and the mike than our sound levels may be born again but right you know but yeah ticker tape is falling from cat is gay to do is a jubilant time here in the podcast it is yeah it is it only took us like five years to get one hundred and it's

music kind of you know picks up and you have to your ears focusing on l his face you know and so you're hearing what she's hearing and you to have to use your imagination you know in and you have to do the right combination and then you know riley will tell you that you know you punch this guy in the face and blood one everywhere to and it's a game that you and ellie both

that plane entirely in your imaginations and it's so cool yeah there's a lot of driving so basically that that whole part that whole half of the game is the two of them hanging out in an abandoned shopping mall together and so it's just sort of sequence after sequence of the find a job book you can just keep pressing

triangle to have them read jokes to each other which fell i mean all of these things they felt very natural they felt very real you know it it really kind of took me back to my childhood yeah i mean the the way that the road and you know teenagers the way that the the way that the writing kind of worked out and that the back and forth between the two of them there's there's a

like there's a like an interesting like innocence to all of it and in even in a in in the mechanics itself because a lot of what you and of doing is playing these games that are basically fun child like versions of the horrible things yeah that he has to do later save the rhetoric mechanics to abusing it to like vandalize a car and like playing

with each other up and you know instead of guns you know getting water guns and then you hunt each other and shoot each other which is you know and it's it's and i think there's a like a metaphorical quality the some of what happens to and that he things to keep breaking down like there's a moment where i mean and if you have read or if you've actually played the game at all l

is barely are already tells you how this is going to end in or she was with a friend the us is how she usually up in the little got it in you know she didn't i see a kind of know that this is going to happen the and you know there's one moment when they get the carousel go in to get the power going in the malian and you know l is on the carousel and then the moment riley jumps on

grinds to a halt in and she's like no live heard of her dad her like very like oh metaphor or yeah yep yep yep and the in so there's that there's the break into a halloween store and which is so confusing with them because they can't imagine a world where you'd like dress up as monsters are they live in a world of monster i'd lie i really like that

that particular element of the conversation you guys were talking about that the kind of fantasy overlay yeah any system it's just a playful sort of thing there's like all these sort of interactive things that you can do you can do with them and it always they keep bringing gameplay and so it doesn't just feel it don't need it it's not it's that

just gone home right it's not it's that simply like click on this thing and listen to story happen you know because there is the brick throwing and because there's water guns like the does actually like it involves some like that but there's no the the only stakes are the stakes that they make up for each other like you know who can throw the most or who can break the most car windows and who can hit each other

most of the water well and if i mean the thing i i played through over plane through that sequence a couple times because if you win or sequence you get to ask rarely one question a racial answer it i like wanted all he answers so can play me to get the answer yes ah but yeah i don't know it was it was definitely it was definitely interesting i for out i was gonna say you can bingo

it is actually we i will say that we started so i came to wire yeah august of two thousand and eleven okay late august so sometime september october when we realized we had critical numbers there were four of us a little hot on gamer it was you and chris baker is and marty cortina yeah and me

oh okay so i mean just trying to like run down all the cool things that how i mean how i know everyone us and say oh yeah was that i think that that's the big challenge of it is is for one thing i think the noncombat sequences were way more interesting than the combat sequences that you also so but you also have to deal with the fact that people know how it's going to end see you have to make like one says where people know how

going to end and there's no combat and you have to make a compelling yeah and they totally do you have the most fun thing it really is a a a triumph of unique gameplay design in that they were able to pull a lot of that often keep it being really fun

i mean at least i think it is because i mean they have do i'm easy you know if they if they throw me into a game and it's like it's story click on things in your get story told to you on like that sounds great i can't wait to do this but i imagine the average last of us player is not really me you know i think they're really looking for like action packed gameplay are

there's there's meet on this bones you know like there's is there certainly that there for them are but there's also another big and character moment arising moment that happens and if he okay i'm i missed this through the first time i was playing with somebody and they have their really oh i totally saw this coming i did i not see it coming out i like the over to say a kind of saigon

well the first i played their i also missed the photo booth oh you did yeah oh so there's a point at which you get a photo booth would just cool because and i'm going to keep referencing this interview that i did but neal said that like the photo booth took forever it was like it is difficult and took his many resources as a collapsing building and uncharted to there for like but the photobooth as you go into

photo with your friend and it's you know you get to pick the theme where is it like friends are like lawyers and some other weird they in you know and then you get to actually pick the faces the girls milk and it's it's cool but you know bit like there's and then at the end it's like send a facebook and they're like what's a face burger yeah oh and they do like inner

she ends up in or in her first and last name or whatever with the last names all blocked out because like a password because you know because all we know in l a last name is but anyway there's kind of an awkward moment between the two of them at the end which kind of you know a in and riley's always sort of been she was originally created to be sort of a mentor figure and lily she's a couple years you know older yep

there's always been a closeness and of course you know l is very angry at her because you know she abandoned her as a friend were told she said a few and took off or sort of unexplained reasons but you know there's an anger that really persists you know that is i don't know maybe deeper than one would expect and also eventually riley says that

this is you know kind of also her goodbye to elect she's about to go off and joined the firefly saturate yet i'm ellie reacts really badly now i'm and the way that it kind of spins out his you know they end up in this other really fantastic sequence and a music store playing music and dance scene and it's and ellie eventually said

don't go and leans over and kisses right riley whilst don't know what actually happened is the kiss and then she rips her dog tag on yeah i i think she rips it off from yeah helps it offers and in throws it away in yeah and then i just don't go and write that ah and that she and i think it we see ellie carry them around the last
