hello everyone welcome to your game live podcast it is friday february twenty first nice phonetic others and are in their yeah but that was an a really stringent inherent thing i liked if i'm and the yes this is your

here at wired and with me in the studio as usual is peter ruben senior editor at wired and lara hudson contributor wired and here we are so on today's podcast what i just want to point out that this is our one hundred episode also true of game live audio podcast in it's current form our audio engineer surely actually reminded me of

heightened for like a whole minute and and gained a lot of experience points because you know i took out so many things you know while in a titan you know that felt that felt pretty good will was also nice about that that to to play is that ah being in a titan and taking out titans are valued so much more than killing as a soldier so you can have people who are kind of really lone wolf he run and gun players and any other team to

the match setting they might not top the leaderboard if you die a lot but you take out titans and your judicious about the way you play your tongue leaderboard for your team so it's a nice reprioritisation it's a more cooperative feeling deathmatch style of play un and most other franchises which i enjoyed and we'll see how it realizes the promise of a game like brink when which purported to

meld single and multiplayer ah oh yeah and pains and kind of failed miserably i sure did but i think this this is ironed out a lot of those kicks that anybody talk on microphones while you were playing but when i'm with the deal is with this because they were mean i don't know if it's people don't want to because they don't need to because of the nature of the game i want because the game really does do a good job of communicating he like what you might want to do right now

i'm or i don't know if it's because the x box one doesn't come with a headset well i will say when i play x called you a ghost on x box one they're certainly people with headsets okay but playing time for i noticed that it was silent so one possibility for that is in the early days of the beta it which may have been press only know they were was always open i think it was always open i think there were before they started sin

the out the beta codes to the people who had registered i believe that some members of the press had gotten mumble we're talking like the night before they oh so nevermind then i was gonna say i believe so i was going to say it strikes me that games journalists would be headset it on average less frequently then gp gamers general populace think they have the headsets i think maybe the

decided to not use them mckenna ever really felt like know when nobody was talking to me you know in doubt he was nobody wanted me to use a headset there no one talked about my mom which was weird that was kind of stranger to listen a little about a little bit little bit stockholm syndrome that but but but but i'm so yeah titan forbid and of course the main that the actual game comes out on march eleven so it's not really like we have to wait a whole

or long time before we can play it again there was kind of sad though is there was the day that it ended i was at work and i was just like omega humbly titan fallen and released like ended at six pm that day ah well i'm type of vol yep oh i'm so at this point the podcast i believe we should start the spoiler section for on let me hein the the the dlc

the last of us which you play it and i played new yeah not blake as you have not played last of our last about why the however completely spoil he had to edit my interview with neil drachma they're so he's i think aware of we say i had to chose to i was blessed with the opportunity to i saw the a is that up now that it is okay here's a regular one and there's an extended one where i talk longer

there is a super cut however deep dive with is the audio oh no no no no it's him as i think the the uncut ones like and are now she's a thousand more were yeah three thousand words versus two thousand where it is actually so there's a short version you can read and then there's a long version yeah if you really want to get a i like talking about some of the more specific things if you know yet if you look for it on the site you'll get a short cut but in that we link out to the longer the one that no one the neil promoted

i think was long on know which is cool arm and so yeah at this point if you for some reason played the last of us but haven't played the dlc or otherwise want to keep yourself spoiler free or do not listen to this segment yeah maybe maybe maybe maybe jump forward and and if you haven't played it and you plan to play you should wait do yourself a favour ago for sure there are yeah yeah yeah

this meant she is the one to know because she actually to type in the episode number every time she uploaded and be three and and i noticed it was coming up and then i totally forgot exotically reminded us of it and then we got into the studio and i totally forgot and then you reminded me of it just now i old are andrea who arrive weekend if if so if these balloons and the confetti gets in our way between us and the mike than our sound levels may be born again but

okay well what you jump in yeah ah i'm sorry i mean you understand basically what happened so i do i think we've discussed all a bit of before the basic premise of it which is that the game takes place at two periods and time at one is sort of after joe gets impaled and into cool yeah it's an inter colder we have people half and the middle of the game so have of it takes place at l his life before she

it's job when she's at a military school in boston ah and half of it takes place after the period where i'm joe gets injured and before you have that amazing deer hunting sequence you never really find out like how what happened like how did she save him like how did she mean no deal with everything and happened after that and it sort of jumps back and forth and it's interesting because the portion that you play

ah in her early life there's essentially no combat ah she doesn't you know have any ability to fight and she's not really presented with situations which he has to fight she's in a mall with her friend riley and they've had a falling out but riley's comeback in there they sort of go to the mall to you know kind of you know have a fun experience together and rallies trying to make it up to her that you know she kind of an abandoned her as a friend some earlier

indistinct point arm but the other half of it also takes place in the mall all of it yes teenage girls and more yeah but second half she's you know the ellie that we come to know in the game where she's really kicking butt and taking names and there's a new functionality that it introduced which had almost been completed for the last game but didn't and so when they had more time for the deal see the went back and implemented it which is that you can

make the humans and the infected fight each other you can kind of hide and throw a brick and then get them to start taking each other out and just sort of watch the carnage go down which is very satisfying it's very enjoyable to watch my i really had only really happens in like there's there's one sequence in the game in which it's very very scripted and which they want you to do it like you're there you can see that those humans over here and infected over here and there's all these bricks

in front of you you know what they kind of make you do it you throw the brick the infected kill the humans pretty pretty decisively the second one for me and he was gonna say but i've had that player two different way oh really yeah i think it depends on like where they are and like well you throw it will either was cool right leg that it could potentially work out different ways the yeah that is that is cool it it said it's dynamic i just i kind of thought that the beaches yeah they did in fact

just devoured the humans because they beat him readied substantially when i played but then it anyway the next encounter after that is definitely a little bit more the infected or sort of the infected or way over here and the humans or maybe a bit more closer in our marcos or they're closer to move on and so it's a little bit more complicated in terms of well what do i do and how are they going to

that each other and they might see me during the fight is a you know we have less of a hiding spot but it was it was cool it was good it was neat to realize oh that's what i get to do now and it also reflects i think you know that i mean this happens any time you play but i think it's an extension of that which is that she's not a melee fighter electoral she's not that big if you go straight out a guy is a really good chance he's gonna take you out right so she has to be stealthier and smarter and she sort of

the fight smarter not harder and end this is you know another way to allow her to do that you know going up against i mean granted we understand that she's you know really tough when you know when she's taking out like a dozen guys you know it makes it feel a little more reasonable for that to be happening so that so basically the the the the combat heavy section is that interpol part where

joelle is injured l years gonna go get medicine for him and i'm back in somewhere in the mall arm then the the the prequel part which i mean i think as we mentioned on the the last episode it runs did it it picks up almost immediately where the the graphic novel i'm the last of us american dream isn't ah ends off so you should read if you really want the full experience read

right you know but yeah ticker tape is a falling from catty okay the gym is a jubilant time here in the podcast it is yeah that is it only took us like five years to get one hundred and that's it is actually i will say that we started so i came to wire yeah august of twenty lot okay late august so sometime september october really realize that we had critical numbers there were four of us it

graphic novel which will take you like a half an hour like right before you play the game yeah and it runs right together or and one night i did the interview with neil drug been created the game he said that he doesn't think they would have done the deal see if they hadn't on the comic i'd say the common the graphic novel or villa from dark horse woman named faith or and hicks ah was corroded and and illustrated it and she i mean yes

as she pretty much created riley she designed her arm and it's it's so cool in a way that you know it was it came out of this process of making this comic yeah and then then they made the game out of it there's so many elements and in the comic they also encounter own this video game it's basically a mortal kombat video games like that but they can use mortal kombat so they made of a different one and then so faith me this character called angel night

just sort of of like up you know a female wolverine x twenty three ish kind of character and one of if not the best sequence in the game involves them going back to that arcade and actually playing the game actually in air quotes year because the cool thing as they start to play the game and it's not working were in their disappointed of rarely says woe we can play it

close your eyes like cure the buttons she starts narrating are like you know you're at the shaolin temple and hear the music kind of you know picks up and you have to your ears focusing on l his face you know and so you're hearing what she's hearing and you to have to use your imagination you know in and and you have to do the right combination and then you know riley will tell you that you know you punch this guy in the face and blood went everywhere to and it's a game that you and ellie both

that plane entirely in your imaginations and it's so cool yeah there's a lot of driving so basically that that whole part that whole half of the game is the two of them hanging out in an abandoned shopping mall together and so it's just sort of sequence after sequence of the find a job book you can just keep pressing triangle to have them read jokes to each other which fell i mean all of the

these things they felt very natural they felt very real you know it it really kind of took me back to my childhood yeah i mean the the way that the road and you know teenagers the way that the the way that the writing kind of worked out and that the back and forth between the two of them there's there's a like there's a like an interesting like innocence to all of it and and even an hour in in the mechanics itself because a lot of what you and of during his playing these games that

basically fun child like versions of the horrible things yeah that ellie has to do later receive the rhetoric mechanics to be using it to like vandalize a car and like play a game with each other and you know instead of guns you're getting water guns and then you hunt each other and shoot each other which is you know and it's it's and i think there's a like a metaphorical quality the some of what happens to and that hear things to keep breaking down like there's a more

where i mean and if you have read or if you've actually played the game at all ellie is barely are already tells you how this is going to end in or she was with a friend is how she originally appeared they both got it in you know she didn't i see kind of know that this is going to happen the and you know there's one moment when they get the carousel going to get the power going in the mall again and you know l is on the carousel and then the moment riley jumps on

grinds to a halt in and she's like no live heard of her dad her like very like oh metaphor or yeah yep yep yep and the in so there's that there's the break into a halloween store and which is so confusing with them because they can't imagine a world where you'd like dress up as monsters are they live in a world of monster i'd lie i really like that that particular element of the conversation over talking about that the kind of fantasy overlay

yeah and it's system it's just a playful sort of thing like all these sort of interactive things that you can be you can do with them and it always they keep bringing gameplay in so it doesn't just feel it don't either it's not it's not just gone home right it's not it's that simply like click on this thing and listen to story happen you know because there is the brick throwing and because there's water guns like the does actually like it

the or gamer it was you and chris baker as and marty cortina yeah and me and so we started doing it again yet and we have had our abs and are flows of personnel ah and and we i think have a good number in and good chemistry and we're back we whether the storms get of our own laziness and we made it all the way to one hundred episode well that's it

the also like that but there's no the the only stakes are the stakes that they make up for each other like you know who can throw the most or who can break the most car windows who can hit each other the most of the water flow and if i mean the thing i i played through our plan through that sequence a couple times me as if you win or sequence you get to ask rally one question oh racial answer it alec one little he answers second plane it to get the answer yet ah but yeah i don't know it was

there's definitely it was definitely interesting i for out i was gonna say there's bingo oh okay so i'm just trying to like run down all the cool things at how i mean i know our us and say oh yeah i was that i think that's the big challenge of it is is for one thing i think the non combat sequences were way more interesting than the combat sequences that you also so but you also have to deal with the fact that people know how it's going to end see you have to make like is says where people know how

going to end and there's no combat and you have to make a compelling yeah and they totally do you have the most fun thing it really is a a a triumph of unique gameplay design in that they were able to pull a lot of that often keep it being really fun or i mean at least i think it is because i mean they have to i'm easy you know if they if they throw me too

and it's like it story click on things in your get story told to you your like that sounds great i can't wait to do this but i imagine the average last of us player is not really me you know i think they're really looking for like action packed gameplay are and they there's there's meet on this bones you know like there's is there certainly that there for them are but there's also another big in character moment rising moment that happens and if you

i'm i missed this through the first time i was playing with somebody and they are they're like oh i totally saw this coming out and i not see it coming out i like the able to say a kind of saigon well the first i replayed their i also missed the photo booth oh you did yeah oh so there's a point at which you get a photo booth which is cool because and i'm gonna keep referencing this interview that i did but neal said that like the photo booth took forever it was like it is difficult and took his

the resources as a collapsing building and uncharted to there for like but the photobooth as you go into a photo with dear friend and it's you know you get to pick the theme where is it like friends are live lawyers and some other weird thing and you know and then you get to actually pick the faces the girls milk and it's it's cool that you know but like there's and then at the end it's like send a facebook in there like what's a face burger yeah oh and they do like inner

she ends up in or in her first and last name or whatever with the last names all blocked out because like a password because you know because all we know in l a last name is but anyway there's kind of an awkward moment between the two of them at the end which kind of you know a in and riley's always sort of been she was originally created to be sort of a mentor figure and lily she's a couple years you know older yep there's always been a closeness and of course you know l is very angry at her because you know she abandoned

as a friend were told she said a few and took off or sort of unexplained reasons but you know there's an anger that really persists you know that is i don't know maybe deeper than one would expect and also eventually riley says that this is you know kind of also her goodbye to elect she's about to go off and joined the firefly saturate yet in l he reacts really badly and

way that it kind of spins out his you know they end up in this other really fantastic sequence and a music store play music and dance scene and it's and ellie eventually says don't go and leans over and kisses riley very was don't know what actually happened the kiss and then she rips your dog tag on yeah i think she rips it off from years and it offers and in throws it away in your and then i still go in

that ah and that shane i think it we see ellie carry them around the last of a few yes and if you look at him due to she carried through up a of us i know she has it in the second section i only she did she has it in the interwar part and you might have had that joke book to yeah okay maybe she does yeah don't worry about and check yeah yeah right right this is the have to go back and check sort of thing but it's

we're going shut down after yeah we're done that's it that's hundred is probably ninety nine too many so i'm so anyway you are absolutely right this episode one hundred and here we are swung today is gala show some extravaganza hundredth anniversary of game wife we started as a small playing card company in kyoto japan or watches where that

you know it's it's it's kind of a it's a it's a fairly big moment for the character oh yeah yeah i'm and and really cool that they decided to do that and your he said that they it just kind of came up naturally so when they did the comic he and of neil and faith that a bunch of interviews about it when they are talking about the relationship between them and and one of them said that you know l riley's really are l is really attracted to riley they just meant sort of in the way that you know

younger people kind of right hero worship older people a little bit but you know then he said he started thinking and it grew in this bigger idea and then became this more fully realize thing but it's cool i mean the a on a lot of levels i think it provides a sort of experience that is so rare you know to be able to play like as young teenage girls you know relating to each a to play as a a girl it all a teenage girl at all a teenage girl who spends the entire game you know

relating to another teenage girl you know and then and also i don't know exactly how to categorize it if it's you know gay or bisexual or if you know it even needs to have a label that way that i mean it's either is really cool that they introduced that element into it to yeah i mean it's it takes a takes one game like that to you go oh cheese that this experiences doesn't exist in this medium outside of like this and you know to other things that i could name right

and so day and and especially with see it at home in a game that is sort of lauded as like that you know one of the best games of last year and sold me butler to copies you know that's that's pretty cool well and ends you know i i also mentioned that to him any you know he he said something similar that it's too bad that there aren't more experiences like this read that so often for you naughty dog has a little more

the only way to make it sound decisions about the yet of stuff but that at a lot of studios it's very precedent driven in on this happens is this isn't just games it's movies it's comics it's a lot of other media where you know in order to do something you you need to be able to look at something else and say it worked before you know and not been able to do that makes a lot more risky so if if this is successful then said that or than other games can say will look it

left behind yep yep well okay all of that part i i i loved i mean i really thought it was it was so well put together i'm the only thing and we were having a discussion about this last only thing that sticks in my craw is that everything was great up until the very very end where i found myself in another one of those forced combat situation

since which is the thing that i liked the least about the last of us everything up prior to that point i was able to stealth my way through the combat situations and i felt i still maintain that still thing my way through last of us combat sequences is more thrilling and fun and interesting for me

then having to shoot my way through them which to me is it it's it's either it somewhere between boring and frustrating it's it's never just that amount of fun for me especially compared to stuffing so i loved sneaking by the infected again i thought the i think that they're the way that they they they create the sense of tension with with audio

and and everything is still sort of pitch perfect and then it was after the kiss so that sort of the technical climax of the whole thing had already happened and now i was just forced into this combat situation just to see the end which was in the end was not even after all that the ending was not even as good as what had happened before i mean it was the ending was sort of a pro forma ending you know what i mean like v the

the great great stuff the really interesting that big twist that had already kind of occurred so i was just sort of like i felt like i was having a slog my way through again this comment see when said he didn't want to do i did something that i just i almost never do which they got so frustrated that i kicked it down from normal that easy then i just i just sort of easy combat it my way through it and is relied on the fact that everything would be weaker and stupid

if don't have the ball i'm we are going to talk about video games that we have been playing the number of them and and also i went to the ah the dice some it as as many of you may know they probably mention it arm and at the day summit you get to go into the red carpet and have very brief interviews with people from the video game world and damn

yeah i mean going through the game i i thought of you chris rock because i you know i knew i'd i'd remembered you talking about your frustrations with you know what you felt forced combat in the previous one you know and partly i think this is because again like your plane is ellie you're playing as a character that isn't as strong and hand to hand but it you really did give you that option to still throughout the game which i thought was cool i'm in your i think for the final confrontation and means is also something that came up with the interview the

cutting it out for space which was that he intended it to sort of be this climactic thing where he wanted her to have to fight me ah for jolla the and because of the very end you know you have droll kind of the injured droll locked up in this sort of area in the mall and these guys are trying to open it and if you don't engage with them for long enough they actually open the lock and they get in and it's game over

you know so it it forces you to move forward and keep fighting them and that was sort of the idea that you have to engage in you have to fight and that also that a lot of what that represents you know comes from the scenes with riley to or she had a friend that she lost statue and that that that's and for mean so much of the you know urgency that alleys feeling that in a she doesn't want to lose someone

again and so like and so she has to fight that said i see where you're coming from and it was difficult and let it was it if it if i hadn't been coming out of having just like gone through last of us and been kind of frustrated with what i felt was an imbalance you know like he didn't feel like it was a game where you could choose how you went through it and then only sometimes you had to kill everyone it felt like it was a game where you could choose how to go

sometimes but most of the time you just had to kill everybody and so when it when it happened again it was about this again now so there is probably a little bit of bias going in basically but but yeah i mean it was it was yeah it was the one it was the one sort of you know kind of niggling complaint that i still but i still had about it but otherwise again it's it's it's really it's it's crazy

what they decided to do with this piece of dlc and how well they did pressure ah i'm i think at this point we should probably cut out to that that that that pre recorded segment that i mentioned which is to say that i went to the that the dice some it out in las vegas couple weeks ago i'm spoke with a fair few people let's see who's in their this year eugene

this who was the winner of the pioneer ward i introduce all of these things in this is fun segment thirty three so don't worry and also a palmer lucky child genius and head of had a vakalis i like that he's gone from from adam for some reason boy genius to shot like sometimes even younger me and live specimen button

going back in time usually eat trade baby a his point of weighed all the possible word choices and pick the one that's funny funniest so here we go here are a variety of interviews from the dice red carpet one of the great things about this year's dice is that i finally got to meet a lot of the in the game creators who are made some of my favorite games of the last year and i actually got to

the with steve gainer how creator of gone home for a little bit on the red carpet mean you have you have any regrets you have anything like oh gee i wish the what a gun that i'm lucky the feel like there's going to i feel like i wish we got married and i wish you hadn't done it that way or this way i mean we're very lucky to not have very big like readers in the middle i a terrible

the stuff out and replace it or anything you can always wish you could put a little bit more at that more detail another thing they thought it would have been so to have that in stores like bigger that's great will be able would say i feel like we have anything we usually know i looked all over and can't find the sniper right where where's the sniper we're going to end this interview here sir

my podcast for that particular day and that killer month arm hello hello everyone i'm we we know that we have had some technical issues with the podcast and reviews weeks and we hope that age where listen to this now you will agree with us that things have been solved and so we appreciate your patience as we work through this are your your constant listenership

then i saw i saw i did that i did that night i spoke with people for like two seconds each and they took the most interesting parts and i edited them all together into a seamless segment which we will dump in the middle of the show is gonna be like brian williams wrapping the news is you can be one of those no charges of of know it's what they actually said okay let's in the in contact as unfortunate yeah i'm so we'll see if you don't like it i promise to never do

after i spoke with steve i actually found myself face to face with about one but two indie game creators of who's games i play over the last year and had just loved right in who made the stanley parable and he was walking down the red carpet with lucas pope who made papers please which was wired game of the year in twenty thirteen and i was really excited to talk to the bathroom and ahead

no idea what to say so enjoy this this stammering awkward interview it's it's great if they were both good sports and i was very nice to meet the bottom so maybe is it is to destroy gone home right just not get out of heart is to destroy video game row right of course i didn't that's what we're here to do to make sure everyone else would agree

would you agree to throw video game yeah you get right but it but in all seriousness i am like big fans of love both your guys works got to play you know bowl games last year really really really fantastic i don't actually know what you saying i pretty much just one to say those are really good video cameras that requires a really good thank you very annoying and try hard it's going to be right i know it's

say i've i have nothing i'm just standing there going like keynes if they're so good i feel like chris farley you know that when big the chris farley interview and you like interview paul mccartney i remember the beatles you you agree with your memory you know our throats cut that's a cool country when we get down to it that's that's what interviews really are we here to kind of like look each other in the eyes a little bit worried

right now and then move on our way i mean i guess are you going to be inspired going to benefit from this interview we're going to put this on our podcast real yeah hug yeah yeah oh gosh thanks for listening to everyone on me have prison the rest of my right do you want to say something nice about him and he can say something nice about yeah it's good to know i get big i going to get out there's there

i'm sure there's something about are you got a i i've known a lot of people in my life lucas is about as going to say one of the people like let's just let's say you're you're not the worse you're not the worst that every have any person i've ever had maybe worse person i've ever met i'd have i'd so on a this is

i didn't know that i always end of the scale i didn't know i would be receiving a very great lot of scale of one the davey davey davey and i'll take second place that enough i spoke with rich hill i'm in it now he is the original creator of john madden football and he's currently chief creative officer

they're an electronic arts and i asked him you know as somebody who spent so much time in the video game industry what should we be watching for in the near future in his answer was very unexpected but if you think about it it actually makes a whole lot of sense if i were gonna take my guard horses is anything you're going to like my got my dark horse is why would a gaming platform be like if it was on a car think about all the time

that american spend it on what are the primary time periods we don't currently have what i came out what i thought the most interesting thing it's vs was the emergence of a car i apply for okay why community bit more about that emerged cars gaming platform because my up my photos always been like going to get myself in trouble you're going good it's going to take you about tremendously excited about that the answer is not thinking strict terms like it's a video cards all right think in terms of

how you interact with the car being part of a larger game to interact with know how that could change your behavior in positive ways and eighty aren't that better yet it's awesome thank you very much i next got to speak with to absolute game industry legends eugene jarvis the creator of robo tron and smashed tv and he was being given the dice pioneer award that night and he was

again for at least another year so about that ah yes so which we smoked should talk about first time the titan fall beta just ended that was a thing that it was it was kind of people were really excited about that people were excited there was a lot of rapturous tweeting and writing about it was yeah you played it i played i played it in what did you think about why i was going to ask you the same thing

they're out with marked her male who was absolutely a video game industry mainstay he's a senior creative director now at zynga but he started programming atari twenty six hundred games or he created and be a jam when he was at midway swimming he just been a fixture in the game industry and are we got to talking about some pretty fun stuff selfless and him you're getting a pioneer word but

who would be here pick for up for a pioneer of or who is your who is your favorite person who is kind of influential getting any any any medical with no english out yeah yeah i mean he almost singlehandedly created the arcade restrained by the way that was be a video game and you know how is this power to his disciples

that's why some what what's your favorite eugene job name is robert try robot tron lot less than the game that brought me into williams electronics the time to work with you and to this day that most amazing thing about that is that it has two hundred fifty five levels you can set that game up some room and it still go

those numbers play the same pacing that modern games have difficulty levels the challenge it's still resonates today it's incredible to me i loved i was playing smash tv i'm terrible horrible but i love i love the what you want to toaster you want to be see our i love the chin see you just murdered fifty people say when a pc our nature of and it was so funny

that was the only way to rally to escape oh that was it was the i was us together you know so much fun with a pig kind of inspired by are running man and global and the horsepower like that the the hardware had so much worse by for that you know we put out one grand and another one another one another and then more lot and more shots yeah it just kept on going over and over and over the top

because the hardware allowed to it is by of said it's pets or it makes lot guys opponent palmer lucky who is the twenty one year old founder of akio us the vr company was also on the dice red carpet because he was a presenter the awards and we got to talking about you know what was going to happen with virtual

reality and how i'd developers our going to support virtual reality and our were that sport was gonna come from and you know he made a very interesting point about i'm in be a game developers really kind of they're they're being grassroots support for virtual reality as opposed he brought the counter example of the sort of failed push up for stereo stopping three d gaming

here is that part of that conversation male rape and like in video thirty one a game developers and helping them make their found that really compatible was some they were trying to do on their own virtual reality on the other hand is going to push from completely the opposite direction eight has been consumers and indie developer saying we want to make virtual reality games we want vr games that the game or think we want to play those vr games and then you're actually seeing

the aaa started to follow that after there's already lot of your contact the only other thing that i can think of the be kind of equipment would be cool the mobile games industry where it was a lot of nbc got it in a scarf or the aaa vr really is being pushed in the game developers and the people who plays what's your favorite crazy akio it's like oh so far to somebody but there's so many crazy ones yet

don't be going elephants is really good would still be going on do you play as an elephant in an abstract cartoon world then you swing your trunk around to smash things in this crazy as trip or something else and we're back live in the studio that was awesome wasn't a grass many arsenic yeah i mean has we haven't heard it maybe you haven't heard it

sure what did you think about it should a well i you know it's certainly a a game that i've been looking forward to it to has if you are unfamiliar with it's lineage this is the first came from respond entertainment which was founded by two of the departed infinity ward founders i believe and and staffed with many of the and that i old infinity ward people who followed them out of activision

i wasn't really carefully while we made that at it is yeah see that and i have to say high quality stuff so as we have a couple more video games we can talk about i want to okay i want to talk about jazz punk going around about octo dad last we talked about not talk about after that okay so i mean there's there was octo dad in january and your game of of february your great in the experiencing really have to have

is jasmine it is very hard to describe jazz punk it is a first person puzzle adventure game i'm the but the everything is super heavily stylized it is a world that is like i am it's it's like themed around retro computers i guess kind of i'm it's

it is deliberately difficult to put into words because it is such an insane sort of experience but you are a secret agent who was sent on various missions but but to say that is to make it sound mundane in which really isn't it is a it is in absurd comedy adventure and so

all of the characters look like icons on men's bathroom doors for some reason except for like the robots which for some reason don't you you just you just go through this this variety of increasingly weird scenarios have like here in the have to infiltrate the soviet consulate you have do i bust into a sushi restaurant and and get something from a that double

and who have to you you end up getting sent to a resort hotel and and all kinds of crazy things happen but it it's dumb it's it is great humor in that everything that happens is unexpected you really if you think you know what's gonna happen when you opt to someone and talk to them you don't because the game really delights in

the setting you up to think that your actions are going to have a certain ah effect as we sort of expected a video games and then making those actions have a completely different effect than the one that you expected and by virtue of subverting your expectations we find really some of the best bike

physical humor that i have ever kind of experienced in a videogame the writing is the writing is solid it's it it says that it's inspired by the naked gun and things of that nature i'm and and you can sort of see that i'm but it is really be like animated physical

humor of the game that makes it as good as it is and i could describe jokes to you but i feel like if i described them to you they wouldn't sound as funny as they are and then i'd spoil the joke so i'd with nothing else to say about it jazz punk has been one of my favorite favorite

the experiences of two thousand and fourteen so i'm definitely looking for all month and a half you got do we all the album ninety days of twenty fourteen thus far it has been really good you should you should definitely check it out and then by no laura has one more she was talk about but i do i even have one more one time when we are you oh right we talk about that one too and i do want to say that the new humble bundle his job

the at the other day and there's some great stuff anti chamber isn't there a guacamole gold edition is in there are dustin leave your tail is in there and and a few others but it's a pretty stellar pack so if you if you do not likes to stay up with the humble bundle announcements that's a good one to eat out for sure all write my turn you have an idea so i'd want to take a second term before you

yeah so as as they went from activision and started responded yea this was basically the return of the team that turned call of duty into the juggernaut that it is today i mean may respond we should point out as an independent see is not like an ea oh is not an engage hardener but it was published by the gate this particular game is published by electronic arts yes yeah

i appreciate that we're going around the room i'm holding the talking stick ah there's there's another game that i have played for some time over the last week or so called the dongen grampa i believe the subtitle is trigger happy havoc know which is not a name that makes any that unlike other title at all so it's kind of it's it's kind of a little bit of battle royale

meets phoenix wright with a tiny splash of persona that sounds weird or february spicy cocktail it is better than there is a lager one on the premises the you are young high school soon you're not really exceptional maybe or in every man had a guy but you get selected to go to the super elite high school and you're so psyched because really give a good as high school for some reason it's going to make him set for life

because that's how the say school also i say they start over and i can be any i wanna be know what like a downloadable game for the playstation veto right yes is of yes so but the ideas everyone else at the school is an ultimate something where it's like the ultimate baseball player like the ultimate programmer like for some reason is the ultimate fashion model they put her into okay his eighties wrestling icon ultimate warrior that know there is there's an ultimate what hacksaw jim

doug in is now good well he was the ultimate wielder of a to buy for and that's why there's an ultimate fighter who is oh a woman who has a more masculine to her like she's yeah she's like for some reason aesthetically everyone else looks a certain way and she looks like a street fighter character okay funny or is just roll with it yeah anyway so you show up there but when you arrive before you even meet anyone things go kind of swirly and then you wake up and you know you lift your head ahead

the desk and then you're in the school but things are kind of weird and you realize that their metal sheets overall the windows i knew you know we kind of meet the other students with their that many i think there's fifteen of you and total and then this crazy panda bear robot jumps up and announced early everyone does as his name is monique huma you'll grow to love slash hate him he's your headmaster and he is a mechanical panda and ashes what it is or been it is role

and million acid trip into showbiz pizza some now it's i i i wouldn't recommend altering your your my you know everything that's what that sounds like yeah no noted i'm not saying it sounds like someone drops a massive before you guys ice i sincerely not recommend that so he informs all of you that new trapped in the high school for the rest your life not only that but there's another way out and that's if you kill somebody

in the school just one person that were oh it may be gets a little more complicated as time goes on our that's all that i'll say the stakes get higher and higher and he just becomes this character that's just like this massive murder troll it's constantly trying to do things to like make you kill each other about the who blackmail your reveal terrible secrets or offer you money from nightmare if but in between that you get

the like spend time and ford relationships of people on who lola who you are to care or have to determine if like and then there's that paranoia about you know if are they trying to kill me right ah is a ayers the are these it has multiple it's its notes a i go to admire the gameplay mechanics you so for the most part it or different rooms and ever so basically mom's don't let you know some murders occur and also

a murder occurred for for the most part you get like free time and then it's just a meeting people and getting the more you interact with a specific person the closer you get in the more you learn their personal story okay i would advise and you inability is from them that will be for useful later but i advise if you can figure out who's going to die you want to talk to them and get their story and abilities before they don't get but then once the death occurs then you enter an investigation state where you go round of the different rooms and collapsed

the clues and once you've collected all the clues i mean you really can try to piece it together on your own but then you are trial sequence which is sort of the phoenix wright is for each death it occurs in the game yes these other two phases the the law and order that happen no get do the investigation and then you go to the trial and if you screw up the trial everyone dies oh words yes so guava never made that yeah it's it's it's er it's like

thank you that is it that is a good distinction make did you do you think that's an overstatement about their role in called duties blockbuster ness as far as a multi player title infinity ward is she kind of it was cod for wasn't it that really became the first oh yeah same multiplayer css it was ill mean it was call of duty modern for modern warfare that took the the emerging

battle battle royale on order and so it mother in law and yeah and there's like up some puzzle sequences that happen during the trial seems that i personally find a little bit annoying but it's really hard to lose a senator who did it kind of roles itself out but it is interesting in kind of trying to piece it together and and going through this entire process and then i mean there is a bigger mystery you know at what and why are you

second this weird high school like why how like isn't aren't the police going to help you are sir you know some up with his parent is there something else more going on ah believe that a that leads me to think there might be something more going on yeah there might be and to once you've won the game sharp also there's up the will there's another mode called school mode which is extra bizarre because it's it takes out a whole of the murder and slip what have you just hung out with everybody over

and then there's this whole other gameplay element that they make you do were like you're just allocating people to like different tasks and like trying to like build like different mona koumas lake but other than that you're just like hang out with each other and little couldn't bring the mail the panda yet he had a result post game content to own army i think it's a separate mode they can just play on a look at and easy as his whole other mechanism but the weird thing about it is if you just like

they didn't i think it really changed a lot of dialogue sleeve and tie up front they're like yeah there's no murdering here but like some people just might talk about murdering each other murdering you are would just ignore it you know is just that didn't have the right right right a sort of refurbishing yeah but other than the it's it's or if any of that sounds interesting the you you will enjoy this game the rules are you have williams yeah william as boroughs made a video game it might be somewhat like this it school

as put it explicitly in which people talk about murder but it never happened now that the never cut up methods yeah on a game now yeah ah ah that's cool yeah i guess you drove my game to close this out his arm a dog is called it's actually called weapon shop day or must say which is continuing i think the the tradition now of just not translating the japanese title

the of your of your video game style ah i'm it is it is one of the games level five the guys who did professor layton and various other video games ah produced to cartridges for the three yes japan called guild zero one and guild zero two and they were collections of smaller games that were done by a variety of designers

and all of these games are actually available on the the downloadable he shot that's the only way to get them for the three as in america and this was the will of the this was the one that was lagging behind our because it is a extremely text heavy game and it just took them while to to translate it on the premise is that a role playing game is going on around you and you are a guy who runs an item

and so various heroes who are trying to defeat the dark lord or whatever it is they're trying to do come to you to my weapon oh cool yeah and so i love this is a is a rhythm game also because the way you forged the weapons is there is a proper the rapper style call and response where it taps out of be and then you have to tap on the the glowing hot metal on the be

but then also in the correct places on the weapon to carve out or for your pound out the weapon that you're trying to make yeah i'm sorry i am i alone am flashing back i'd buy may be completely misremembering this but ah some of the craft progressions er sku progressions and feeble worked somewhat similarly never played it now so i couldn't tell you okay

the and i've only played about an hour of this i and so far what has happened is people from into the shop they said i need such and such weapon and like okay i make it for them then there's a little mini game where you disrupt the sales on at the polish it up before you handed out and you this rent them and so will it starts doing is it says okay pay item shock i what quest should i take and so you you you look at this guy's level you look

call of duty siri could never call of duty to was like popular yeah but you know it wasn't it wasn't the the call of duty the world's biggest videogame ever but it was call of duty modern warfare that a reinvented the whole genre remember the whole genre up to that point was world war two who yeah that's very later is robert to some other than my counter strike him and things like that in the right

the various quests he could embark upon and you're looking at the weapons that you have to rent him and you're making a determination of what quest i'm going to send him out on because of the go out in the question they die didn't get paid so you're really trying to match up with the requests there is a twitter like system in the game so it when they go out on their quests i'm vey it's called i'm grind casting

and it is explained away in a completely ridiculous manner but basically the thing to say is they all tweet while they're on their quest on their cause i'm an evil class yeah and so they are tweeting with hash tags and everything slashed exits pretty funny when they're doing stuff so you can keep an eye on what they're doing in their outside the shop and the the the the the grind caster the twitter feed it just runs

that's a even when you're in the rhythm games like you can see you can keep up with the the feed to see how they're doing or you could just jump into it and sort of scroll through it and then we know if they survive they come back and they return the weapon to you in you eat you get paid and damn if they find anything out there you might get that to like more materials make more weapons and so far it's it's pretty funny and the gameplay is a is pretty good nice

yeah not going to shop there is a shop and i am all of the guild games are good to varying degrees i never it the so there's one that's actually by i'm yeah sumi matsunaga data vagrant story you know in some of this sort of weird square enix roleplaying games arm and there he did our final fantasy twelve to right so i'm and that is a pretty intense

that's strategy roleplaying type game that i never really got into one that i played all the way through which is really good was called the starship damn murray and it's just a first it is a it is a i'm it you are the basically the lone survivor on a starship that a sort of adrift in space and you can't get out of your sleeping capsule but you hacked the the the like the cleaning robot

the system and so you are wheeling robots around in front of first person mode around the ship to accomplish things from york capsule in there in that is really cool i really like that one yet so the all the games are are pretty good strike them and a and they're actually all on sale through the it this weekend and everything except for weapon shop the say is three dollars a laugh

pretty good so anyway if there are good guy that is the end of new business i say we we call this meeting was closed during this well you been listening to the game live podcast production of us here at wired i have been your host chris color peter ruben and or hudson have been here in the studio with me i'm sure to welcome yell at me on twitter i am at cohen heat and k o b

the u n h e eighty so feel free to tell me any of your problems i don't necessarily want me to tell you any of your problem right but some of your problems would be okay we're ah topic problem on topic problems ah i'm it's lara underscore hudson as ellie you are a each you de eso an arm and you want to tell me what my problems are yeah cause lord knows

don't get enough of that on the internet as it is on twitter as prove himself p r o v e an s e l f and if you want to send us a i'm a m p three remakes of us performing rappers delight you are free to do so always just any time just center right along think you offer listening the you guys for being here today and we will see you next week proof

right right but like the the it was very popular and people were making all these knock offs of like you know of of period pieces yeah i'm in so modern warfare set things in a very near future sort of setting and that was a big shift for call of duty because again the the the this this even the call of duty medal of honor sort of thing was like it it had it's origins in that like you know realistic

somewhat realistic you know historical type with i thing but it also took military shooters and brought it to the level of a halo yeah quaker were we're and were in so it it yeah basically and so modern warfare harm you know that really was the thing that kind of like establish not only the the genre is being the huge sort of world beater that it is now but also that particular

the timeframe ah in that particular sort of experience i'd also like to point out that i played the single player campaign three times on three different i just played it and then i'd ramp up the difficult to hide again and i'd rather the i don't know there was just something about that game i think for whatever reason it just resonate with me also but although the interesting thing here is that titan fall i didn't

really this i i type this information was out there but i didn't really realize it until just recently hey doesn't have a campaign rainfall is a multiplayer only game in fact we just got the review copies of our plants vs zombies garden warfare also for me i also fry exclusively on x box you know systems and that to we say is a multi player and only x box live gold required

we've been listed a cadre of of audio experts in the office i mean we've we've borrowed mike's we've had outside people come in your hands of friends you're trying to fix this year so hopefully this will do the trick yes indeed was their problem was when i'm there with there were there was a level problem last week nobody could hear any of us were resolved know you i thought that

experience which is interesting because i played the the first thing you do with titan fall as you play the tutorial yeah i'm in it walks you through like a sort of a half an hour i'm thing that just teaches you all of the basics of movement in shooting and you know getting into a titan and we know he can do when you doing that which is nice about three times as long as your usual training tutorial level anyhow dude it's extensive it or trivia and i really like

the and i kind of i found myself thinking i wish there was a single player adventure because it's almost they mean it's it's mirrors edgy in terms only control the have how how fast you run you can double jump you can all while ron you can jump between walls it's like this actually feels pretty good as a first person platform he kind of game but unfortunately

that's not reflected in there in how he actual structure the web or far because they are multiplayer necessarily they are they are online is an online multiplayer normally game and even know if it some at the i'm sure this information is out there know if they're split screen i don't know if there is any off that's a good question i don't yeah i don't i don't know either sure we should look into that we should look at that

so as far as gameplay goes you know i certainly enjoyed myself i think that what's nice about it is being a more far future let's say version of know the associate or effort it takes elements of halo in in your kind of super human qualities on the double jump that wall runs you just you feel a lot more like a spartan than you do

you don't military operative on planet earth and because of that ah it it makes the there's also another element of of halo play which is this kind of posts mission extraction so yeah if you're playing the attrition model which is their version of a team deathmatch palm beach play to a certain point threshold scored kill threshold once that's done the losing team

has to get to an extraction point get picked up and we had out in order to get a score bonus way of the rams that i played it seemed like from one to three people would make it to the extraction yeah yeah i want and will can you can try to shoot them as they're leaving enjoy hundred and that is why want to the only we only got blown up once there was once we were up against a team that really had kind of dominated us they knew what they were doing and i got to the drop shipping out to the extraction

point all like there were four of the opposite team members they were all in titans and they were all firing on the ship simultaneously and that ship blue they took out the whole ship yeah oh well i drop ship that's awesome i did not see that have you that i mean but yeah i think you have to like you really have to concentrate heavy weapons fire on it for a while to do it

so you bring this up there's there's two really interesting things that are going on here number one i really like how they they basically store a fide multiplayer matches like typically you know i don't do a whole lot of multiplayer first person shooter and but like the match starts and you just begin totally there is no reason why you're there you're on the battlefield you're in the middle the battlefield

not even on the battlefield yeah you're in a drop ship what are you think so and most games you start middle the battlefield oh i see in most in than in in other games you know that when when the battle ends everything just freezes and it ends like inflicted the game is over so number one from a cool kind of aesthetic standpoint this game begins with you in a drop ship you jump out of the drop ship and then you're in and then so there's like a a compelling

the reason for why this battle is getting out of nowhere is your a soldier you're going out of that's why you're starting this battle now everything's kind of going on around you you fight the battle and then it doesn't just abruptly end it says were you know we're getting killed drop ships come in a and all survivors get to the drop ship in and get out and so then then there's a storyline reason for why the battle is ending that point one point

the pattern i thought i just couldn't get the volume high enough on my computer that's that's based i blamed myself yeah exactly see you blame the victim and victim know i'd imagined lauren home fast forwarding through the podcast like everything else that anyone else said just trying to get to her own right right or name address but but but i'd be myself to the you don't get you to a or i'm i'm chris color i am the editor of game like

to every single time every single battle but i played i lost i did not win an elite during the entire titan fall battle my team never won a battle now of course you know the you might point out that the one constant between every team that i was on was me and that was the same taco are the bane of other video gamer say that

there are occasional moments where i was not the worst person i'm so but we never won but i always had a blast because even in defeat there was an element of you could you can win defeat or lose defeat yeah because if you after your defeated manage to run to the drop ship and get yourself on to the drop ship without dying and and blast

staff you get a bunch of you have boatload of experience points for haven't done that i'm and you feel really good about yourself you actually feel good yeah i'd i'd i did yeah that's absolutely true i've yeah yes there's a big yeah a moment when you get are not as i our i never thought about myself as having lost if i was able to get onto the drop ship and file and also when you get on the drop ship depending on how earlier there you are

you have other enemy soldiers coming up and try to take you out while you're in the drops at your you have to basically fire on them from with the from the safety of the drop ship that's her and then there's more so the and then the other quick element to that to that epilogue section is one of the round has been kind of announced over the have to get to the drop ship if you get killed at that point there's no response would get killed at the beginning of that epilogue section you just have to sit there and you expect hate and it's so much more from

trading than just being killed and getting kicked out to the lobby yeah because you are at least i could be having more fun but after watch other people have fun yeah yeah yeah so a couple quick note on time for that i enjoyed in particular were ah i like that so there there's kind of a two tiered gameplay you play as a soldier and then you can get in a mech known as a titan and play in the titan each of those

has classes so obviously they're soldier yeah classes that you can play you can country darn close quarters combat or be an assassin or what have you and then your titans can also be calibrated two different types of gameplay and i enjoyed that aspect of it finding a titan class that wasn't the exact same play styles my soldier class but then being able to do both being more of a tank as a titan but being more kind of roam around and and

people have silently as a soldier so i enjoyed that kind of melding of play styles and i also really enjoyed some the weaponry in particular there's a smart pistol that you use it has an auto lock feature yeah which makes it feel much more like a primary weapon than any other pistol i've ever used in a younger we i really really appreciated i didn't play enough to level up enough within the classes to play with scope so i played iron sights only essentially for all the

that are you so i can't really speak to the modifications of the weapons which is always a big draw the shooter but there are so many other elements of this game that i don't think that that will be as much of a compelling yea or nay i'm certainly the the cut an acrobatic superhero nature of of the run done is a lot of fun gavel bangs yeah yeah without you i i don't

well at first person shooters having played the titan fall beta i don't really see that changing for me like playing it it's like oh that's right this is why i don't really play this is just not my genre i'm but at the same time it really it it was more fun i think that i've ever had with a multiplayer shooter it's because i think that they have correctly reef thought how do we make this funny even if you're dying

and how do we make you feel like you are accomplishing something even if i mean like it was really great to like after getting blown up in a titan so many times like thirty seconds after i get in there was it was really fun when i was able to stick around in a titan for a little bit longer by judiciously running away and when we know recharging my shields coming back doing some more damage leaving and then you know as it was there will ever have you know i said it

hello everyone welcome to your aim like patasse is friday february twenty first nice phonetic others aren't you yeah that was and a really stringent here saying i like arm and ah yes the saw your

you're wired and which city are as usual is peter ruben senior editor at wired and mara hudson contributor line and theory so on today's podcast what i just want to point out this is our one hundred episode also dream of game live audio podcast in it's current see our our audience year after year civil minded views

whole minute and and game a lot of experience points because he likes of out some things you know while the title i'm you know that felt that fabric deck was also nice about that that to to is that being in a titan and taking out titans are valued so much more than killing as a soldier so you can have people who are kind of really lone wolf run and gun players any other team

max settings they might not top the with if you die a lot with he got titans near the dishes but the way you play your have leaderboard so it's a nice reprioritisation item more cooperative ceiling deathmatch style of play get most of rochester judge we'll see how it realizes the promise of a game like range which purported to

melt single and multiplayer el pais concealed yeah sure the but i think this this is i and other ones did anybody talk on microphones were you will find good i'm with the deal is with this is it i mean i don't know if it's people don't want to because they don't need to because the nature of the game i want because the game really does do the job or communicate you like what you do right now

or i don't know if it's because the x box one is heads well i will say when i play x ah called you goes on x box one they're certainly people heads of the playing time for a noticeable asylum so one possibility for that is in the early days the data it which may have been present know he was always open i think was always of i think they were before they started sin

the out the been a code said people with registered i believe that some members of the press had gotten mumble we're talking like than naples oh so nevermind oliver said i believe so i was in say it strikes me that games journalists with the headset it on average less frequently than gp games generalize the they have the headset second maybe the

decided to use the mckenna really felt like know when nobody was talking to you know that he was still be in who's a headset yeah no one talked about my mom's was year list of a little robot look at stockholm syndrome now i'm so yeah forbid and of course the that the actual game set of march eleven cells

he played again it was kind of sad is it was the day that it did i was at work was site omnivore humbly titan fall nebulous like ended at six pm that day ah well point eight yeah i'm so at this point the possibly be snarky spoiler section for me i know of the that the dlc

last of us it's you played i played get not like the played last summer why i do however believe is what he had to edit my interview with know that he said he's think aware of we say i had to chose to i was blessed with the opportunity to ah is that up on it is ok here's a regular one in there is an extended one where i saw fonder

there is a super cut ah deep die with is it oh no no no no it's and as i think the the unhurt ones uttered this is a thousand more yeah three thousand words to does she is actually to this short version you could reading the longer yeah you really want to get a i like talking about some more specific next it yeah yeah if you report on the site you'll get a short cut but in that we make out there was a one that learn that neil promoted

i think the long know this is cool i'm so yeah at this point if you for some reason play the last of us but haven't played the dlc or otherwise my keep yourself spoiler free i do not listen to this segment yeah maybe maybe maybe maybe jump forward and and if you haven't played it and you plan to play you should wait do yourself a favour yeah for sure your pocket

she is the one to know because see access type in episode three ah and and i noticed of is coming up in that he couldn't provide exactly reminded us of it and then we got into see the i totally forgot the you reminded me of it just all around great movie ride weaken it so if these balloons and the confetti gets in our way between us and mike that are sound levels maybe worked again but

okay well that you jump in yeah ah i'm sorry and new understands basically what happened so i do i think we've discussed all of it a before the basic premise of it which is that ah the game takes place at two periods of time at one is sort of after ah joe gets to interpret yeah it's an inter colder ah we have people have and the middle of the game so have of it takes place at alleys lives before she

it's job when she's at a military school in boston ah and have that takes place after the period where i'm joe gets injured and before you have that amazing deer hunting sequence you ever really find out like how what happened like how did she save him like how did she you know deal with everything happened after that it sort of jumps back and forth and it's interesting because the portion that you play

ah in her early life there's essentially no combat arm she doesn't he know have any ability to fight and she's not really presented with situation suggest fight she's in a mall with her friend riley and they've had a falling out at rallies come back in there is sort of go to the malls if you know items you know have a fun experience together rallies trying to make it up to her that you know she ponders an abandoned her his friend some earlier

the sticks point ah but the other half of it also takes place among all of it yes teenage girls and malls yeah but second half she's you know the alley that we come to know the game she's really kicking butt and taking names and there's a new functionality that it introduced which had almost been completed for last game but didn't and so on they had more time for the deal see the went back in implemented which is that you can

make the humans and infected friday shop you can kind of hide and throw a brick and then get them district to each other out and just sort of watch the carnage good i'm just very satisfying it's very enjoyable to was really had only really happens and like those is one in which it's very very scripted a mistake want to do it like you're there you can see that their students over here to fact it over here and there's all these bricks

in front of you you know economy you do it he throw the break detected kill humans pre pre decisively the second half of he was gonna say but i've had that planted were also yeah i did it depends on like where they are like well throw it why that was cool right leg that it could potentially work at the yeah that is that is all it it says that i just i kind of thought the just yeah they did in fact

the devoured the humans as they beat up reading substantially of i played am but then get anyway the next encounter after that is definitely a little bit or the infected or sort of infected are way over here and humans are feel be more closer quarters they're closer move and so it's a little bit more complicated in terms of well what about you how are they

each other the my seat during the fight the they have less like spot but it was he was cool it was good it was need to realize oh that's what i get do any also reflects i think as i mean this happens any time you play a but i think it's extension of that wishes that she's now mainly fighter the job she's not a big if you go straight out a guy he's really good chances them take you up prices she has to be stealthier and smarter

fight smarter not harder on yet another way to allow her to do that know going up against i mean granted we understand that she's you know really tough but you know what she's taking out like a dozen guys you know it makes it feel a little more reasonable for that to be happening so that so basically the combat having sex is that interpol part where

joelle is jerk elegans get go get medicine for have an outback summer long arm then the big freak what part which i mean i think as we mentioned up the last episode it runs it it it hicks up almost immediately where the the graphic novel ah the last of us american dream isn't ah it's off so you should read if you really want full experience read

you know but yet ticker tape is a fun day to jump is a jubilant time here in the pot as it is evidence it only for it's like five years puts it is actually i will say that we started so i came away yeah august of twenty okay late august so some time september october we realized we had critical numbers there were four of us

graphic novel which will take the like a half hour like right before he played in yeah it it runs a together one and one night i did the interview with neil driven created the game he said that he doesn't think they were done deal see if they hadn't thought i'd say the common the graphic novel very dark horse or woman named faker and hicks ah was corroded and and illustrated it and she knew

as she pretty much created right she designed her arm and it's it's so cool in a way that you know it was it came out of the process of making this comic yeah and then then they made the game out of it there's so many elements and in the comic they also encounter on this video games basically a mortal kombat video game right that but they can use moral comments they made a the crew on and then so faith me this character called angel knives

the server like up in a female wolverine six twenty three dish and character he arm and one of it's not we best sequencing the game involves them going back to that arcade and actual playing game actually in airports yeah because the cool thing as they start to play the game and it's not working in are disappointed read this as well we can place

close your eyes a cure the buttons she starts married and like you know grandchild and tempo and hear the music kind of you a picks up and you have to your ears focusing on alleys his face you know and so you're hearing what she's hearing and you to have to use your imagination you know you have to do the right combination and then you know riley will tell you that you punch this guy in the face and blood one everywhere and it's at a game that you and ellie post

the plane entirely in your machinations and it's so cool yeah there's a lot of driving so basically that that whole part that whole the again is the two of them hanging out in the bandage shopping together and so it's just sort of sequence after sequence of the find a job but he's you can just keep pressing triangle to have the real jokes to each other which felt any or all of

states they felt very always felt very you know it he really had to be back to my childhood ninety the the way that the right just the way that that the way that the writing and of worked out that the backup for it there's there's a there's a my and an steam like innocence to all of it and and even an hour in in the mechanics itself is a lot of what you're doing is playing these games that are

basically spawn child like versions of the horrible things yeah that only has related see the dark mechanics year of using it's like vandalized current like play a game with each other and you know instead of guns yoda getting water guns and then you want each other and shoot each other which is you know and it's it's in i think there's a like a metaphorical quality the some of what happens to and that he a things keep breaking now as a mom

where i mean and if you've read or if you've actually played the game at all alleys italy are already tells you have him in a she was with a friend he is how she was lit up at the little cabinet in you know she didn't i see kind of know that this is gonna happen and you know there's one moment when that they get the carousel power going malian and you know l is on or the carousel and then the moment riley jumps on

ryan's to a halt me she's like no heard that like were like oh metaphor or yeah yeah yeah that and the those the hand there's how great hobby store which is so confusing with them because they can't imagine a world where you like dress up as monsters are they live in a world of master i'd lie i really like that that particular fence

yeah and the stop it's just a playful sort of thing is like all these sort of interactive things that can be in do with them arm and it always they keep bringing gameplay so doesn't just feel they don't you it's not it's not just brought right it's not it's that simply right click on this thing was the story happen you know because there's a brick throw it because with water guns like the does actually like it

the or it was you and chris baker as and marty courtiers yeah and and so we started doing it again the up and die we have had our ups and are slows personnel ah and and the i think have a good number of good chemistry and we're back he whether the swamps get some our own laziness and he needed all the way he said well that's it

also i got that there's no the the only states or the states that they make up for each other like you know who could throw the most be break the most harvey knows each other support for any i mean the thing i've i played through aeroplanes vatican's a couple times me his if you win the sequence it ask around one oh racial answer it i like want our history second plane it to get the answer yes ah but yeah i don't know is

definitely is definitely interesting of and say he's can go oh okay so i'm just trying to like wonder how harm hours and say oh yes that i think that's the big challenge of it is is one thing i think the non combat sequences were way more interesting than the combat sequences that you also suit but you also have to deal with the fact that people know how it's going to end see you have to make sequences were people know how

going to and and there's no combat you have to make compelling yeah and they totally do the most fun thing it really is a ryan's out unique gameplay design in that they were able to whole lot of that also keep it or i mean at least i'd as they have you i'm east you know if they if they crummy me too

it's like it story click on things in your get story told you i'm like that sounds great i can't make you do this but i imagine the average last of us player is not real good i think they're really looking for like action aid or need there's there's need on the bones you know like this a certainly that there for them are but there's also another big and character mom rising moment and happens if you

i'm i miss this through the first time i was playing with somebody and they they really i so we saw this coming i did i not see coming i i'd like the i got this a while the percent play through i also miss the photo oh did yeah so there's a point at which you get or photobooth which just cool has an omelet references interview that i did neal said that like the photo was took forever it was like is difficult and took his

the resources it as collapsing building and uncertainty of the for like but the photo as you go into a photo with your friends and it's you know it'll pick the seeing resurrect friends or live long in some other weird thing in you know and then you get to actually put the pieces the girls yeah i'm and it's it's cool that you know bit like there's and then at the end it's like send a facebook know what's a face but yeah yeah ah oh and they do like inner

she ends up in rehearsal whatever with the last names all blocked out because like a password you know you know nowadays last names but anyway there's kind of an awkward moment tina to them yeah which kind of you know am and riley's always had been choose originally created to be sort of a mental thing he relishes couple years you know older yeah i have always been a closeness and of course you know l is very angry at her because you know she abandoned

as a friend were old she said a few and took off her to serve unexplained reasons ah but the there's an anger that really persists you know that is i don't know maybe deeper than one would expect the and also eventually riley says that this is you know kind of also her divide elish such go off during fireflies xetra yeah i'm ellie reacts really badly mom and

way that it kind of sends out his you know they end up in this other really fantastic sequence in a music store playing music and dance scene and it's an alley eventually says don't go and means over and kisses driver riley still what actually happens the piss vinci groups or dog tag on yeah i think she rubs it off her yeah since it offers in rosie way you and then either

that ah and that she and i think it is c l e carry that you're on the last issue yes and if you work out of it does she carried through up a while since i know she has it in the second section i only she she has it in the interwar part it's you might have had the job for sale yeah okay these guys yeah i think about hampshire yeah it right this is the have to go back and jackson but it's

we're going to shut down yeah we're done that's it that's hundred it's how many ninety so i'm so anyway you are absolutely right this episode one hundred your we are slanted a is carla show some extravaganza hundredth anniversary been ah you started a small plane part as a watches with it

you know it's it's it's kind of a it's a it's fairly big moment of the character oh yeah yeah i'm and and really cool that they decided to do that me and yeah he said that they it just kind of came up naturally so when they did the comic kinda ask me on faith did a bunch of interviews about it on you're talking about the relationship between them and and one of them said the in a riley's really are l he's really attracted arrived they just meant sort of the way that you know

younger people kind is right hero worship older people a little bit you know that he said he thinking and grew this bigger idea and then became this more fully realize thing but it's cool i mean it on a lot of levels that he provides the sort of experience that is so rare he have yet to be able to play like as young teenage girls you know the leading to reject the plaza a girl it all a teenage girl at all the teenage girl who spends the entire game you know

relating to another teenage girl you know and then and also i don't know exactly how to categorize it if it's you know gay or bisexual or is he only needs to have a label that that i mean it's either is really cool at the issues that almonds to yeah i mean it's it takes a piece one game like that go on cheats the this experiences doesn't exist it was outside of like this him you know to other things that i could name right

and so the and and especially to see it at in a game that is certain want it as like that know why the best games last year insult bullets copies of that's that's well and ends you know i i also mentioned or to him any you know he said something similar that it's too bad that there aren't more experiences like this right that so often forget naughty dog has a little more

the way to make it sound decisions are just stuff but that a lot of studios it's very precedent driven he on this happens is this is just games in a movies it's comics to lot of other media where you know in order to do something you need to be able looked something else to say it worked before you know and not been able do that makes a lot more risky so if if this is successful than said than other games can say will look it

a heinz yeah yeah spell okay all that part i i i was really thought it was was so well put together i'm the only thing we're having discussed about this last week the and it sticks in my craw is that everything was rate up until the very very in where i found myself and another one of those sports combat situation

these which is the thing that i like the least about the last up everything up prior to that point i was able to stop my way through the combat situations i felt i still maintain that still stopping my way through last of us combat sequences is more thrilling and it's fun and interesting for me

then having the superhighway which to me is it it's it's either it somewhere between bore you fostering it's it's never just that i'm not a fun for him especially compared to stop site love seeking by the infected i thought the i think that they're the way that the they they create the sense it and chin with with audio

everything's still sir it's perfect and then it was after the test so they sort of the technical climax of the whole thing already happened i'm and now i was just for into this combat situation just to see in which was in the end was not even after all that the ending was not even is good as what had happened before our media was the ending was sort of a pro forma in you know i mean like the the

the great great stuff the really interesting the big twist that it are you supposed sort of like i felt like i was having slog my way through game this comments was at said good quality i did something that i just i almost never do which they got so frustrated that i keep the down for normal the east and i just i just or it's easy combat it my way through and is relied on the fact that every good pretty good stuff

we are going to talk about video games that we've been playing a number of them ah and and also i went to the our the dice some it as as many of you may help the that ah enacted a summit in getting onto the red carpet and have very brief interviews with obstacle from the video game world

yeah i mean going through the game i i thought of zurich is i in i knew i'd i'd remembered you talking about your frustrations with you know what you have sports comment and previous one you don't and partly i focus is because again like your plane is ellie your planes character that isn't strong hand but you really did give you the option to stealthier of our school are in your i think for the final confrontation and is is also something that came up with the interview older

the having it out for space which was that ah he intended it to sort of be this climactic scene where he wanted her to have to fight he ah for jolla hands of the very end you know you have jaw kind of the injured joelle locked up in the sort of area in the mall and these guys are trying to open and if you don't engage with them prolong of the actual open the lock and they get any inescapable

you know so it it forces you to move forward and like heat fighting them and that was sort of the idea that you have to engage in have to fight in that also that a lot of what that represents you know comes from the scenes with riley to or she had a friends or that she lost cetera and that's that's and for mean so much of the you know urgency alley ceiling that in a she doesn't want someone

and so like and so she has not said i see where you're coming from in it was an editor at if it if i hadn't been coming out of having just like go through last of us and pain and a frustrated with what i felt was an imbalance you know like he didn't feel like it was a game where you could choose how you went through it and then only sometimes you have to kill everyone felt like it was a game where you could choose how to go

sometimes but most of the time you just had i'm in so when it will happen again i was out this again he also there was probably a little bit of bias going in basically but but yeah i mean it was it was yeah it was the one it was the one sort of you know how niggling complained that i still that i still had some but otherwise again it's it's it's really it's it's crazy

what they decided to do with this piece of we'll see how well they do pressure i'm i think at this point is probably cut up to that that that that pre recorded second dimension in which is to say that i went to the at that the dice some it out in las vegas couple months ago i'm spoke with a fair few our people would see who's it aired is yeah eugene

this is the arbiter of the paint your reward am i introduce out and six point seven so don't worry and also a palmer lucky child genius dad had a head of the optimists i like that he's gone soft rock out for some reason boy genius to shot like younger i mean i suppose when that

during that entire you trade baby and just point i've weighed all the possible words i'm so here we go here are a a variety of interviews from the dice red carpet one of the great things about this year's dice is that i have finally got to be a lot of the in the in readers who lab need some of my favorite games of the last year i i actually gets

with steve painter operator gone home up for a little bit on the red carpet you have you have any regrets you have anything else have to see what it what you see like going thing i feel like i wish or does he have like that where is where we're very lucky to not have at the high reviews the i have several

the not our lives in is always wish you could be hard at that more detail how do you think they are possible him or his lights legal that's great the only say i knew there is usually know higher out all over on the right where if we're going to end his interview here the

after i spoke with steve i actually found myself face the for he's out with that one but two why in the game creators of his games i play over the last year and had just look at db right in our who movie the stanley parable and he was walking down the red carpet with lucas pope who made a brief pleased with was wired scheme of the year when you thirteen up and i was really excited to talk of the ball from ahead

no idea what to say so enjoy this this stammering awkward interview it's it's great if they were both good sports and that is very nice to be so is it is to destroy going on right now get out part used to describe video roll right or smaller you to do to make sure everyone else would agree

would you rate this right right but it will all seriousness i might have local your guys works that way of idaho vice you're really getting really bad as i don't actually know what you say i pretty much is left say those are bringing a video card of really good at out that a point where i know i see

you know i see the signs on a very large scale of one the beach or he's like a healthy sudden i spoke with rich hill and now he is the original creator of john madden football and he's currently chief creative officer

they're an electronic arts and i asked him you know a some you spent so much time the video game industry what should be watching for in the near future in his answer was very unexpected but if you think about it it actions since he i run as a high guard corps which is why am i got i got was is he would get five or be like if it was on a park about this

the fire inside the house he why a lot of rather see as was emerging powers of my hands so why some you read more about it emerged hard for my my thought is always been lying to get myself in trouble you got it and as he can i say that has decided that the answer is is not good script for like is a video pass all right he charge

how you interact with harvey heart of a larger get you in iraq you know how that change your behavior have a positive ways and that are get you very much less i next target got speak to absolute game industry legit eugene jarvis of the creator of rubble prawn smashed t v and he was being given that the dice pioneer award that night and he was

again for at least another year sabathia ah yes so what's shouldn't talk about first the title fall beta just that was update the it was a lot of people who really said people were excited there was a lot of rapturous tweeting writing your what south you played it i played i played it in what did you think why i was gonna ask you the same thing

they're out with mark term now who was absolutely a video game industry mainstay is a see your creative director now it's zynga but he started programming party twenty six hundred games he created in the a jam or he was at midway so he's just been a fixture against the streets arm and our we got talking lots of pretty fun stuff self sustaining you get the i your word but who

that would be here for your hear why who is your is your feet or it's vital her you are helping us out there i was saying he tweeted the are you swing a bat why was he a video or we're all his response see how his disciples

here are was what's your favorite eugene job easy easy rather try try and a lot of the aim that brought me and like the kind of your hand out to this day that most amazing thing about the aim is that it has to have the five levels you can set that yeah mafia life in some room and it still

today the same pacing the our that modern games have different rp levels a challenge a high school was nice today ah it's incredible from the holy sites receiving corps but i love i love the what you wanted poster you want to be see our i love it should see this murdered a people thing with me see our the throughout any supply

was going on what's around ginger his palaces i chose the i was just you know it was a get inspired by the in the horse power like that the hardware as a much worse be put out one another one more than what lot more shots yeah it is it over and over normal

because hardware allow it is heightened sense of i was sick or it looks like ice palmer lucky or who is the twenty one year old founder of occupants the vr company was also on the dice red carpet out was a prisoner the words and dumb we got to talking about you know what was going to happen with virtual

reality it's how wide developers our jones port virtual reality and dow were that sport was going on from and you know he made a very interesting point about up in the again developers really kind of their they're being grassroots support for virtual reality as posed arm he brought the counter example of the sort of failed push up for serious topic read the cage so

the years that part of the right like video saudi were i even at all or some help them make their other reading or have also are you on your own virtual reality on the other hand is that mood for the the opposite running eight is that consumers had a good you developers saying we want to make virtual reality games he want your kids in the game or thing we want to play those the organs like then you're actually seeing what

replay sort of all that are he was we are on eaten all the other thing that i think of a little the who have a mobile see where like a lot of got in the sorry what your allies i love the really is he was like the game developers and publishers what's your favorite crazy he was like mozart there's so many crazy ones you love

the job be going elephants is really good let's let's play as an elephant in an abstract art world let you swing your trunk around the smash things in this crazy ass for rural six or something else and back live in a ceo that was awesome was wasn't were many young yeah and we have we haven't heard it maybe you have

sure what did you see a well i are you know it certainly a game that i've been looking for it has or if you are unfamiliar with it's use this is the first game respond entertainment's which was founded by two of the party unity ward founders i leave and and staff with many of the child infinity ward people who follow them how package

so as as they went from activision that started responding yea this was basically the return of the team that turned how do the into the juggernaut that it is today i mean a response point out is an independent sits knowledge is not a partner but he was published by the get this particular game is published by yes yeah

thank you dad is that is a good steak make i'm did you think that's an overstatement about their role in called duties blockbuster this as far as a multiplayer type infinity ward is kind of it was cod for wasn't it it really came first oh yeah same multiplayer css it was immediate was call of duty modern for modern warfare that took the the emerging

the are hidden never call of duty to was like popular yeah but you know it wasn't it wasn't that the call of duty the world's biggest the yogi have but it was call of duty modern warfare that a reinvented the whole jacques the never the whole genre up to that point was world war two it out that's very later robert you rather than my counter strike things like that right

right right but like the it was very popular works is not offs of like you know of out of here it is yeah i'm in so modern warfare set things in a very near future sorted said it was a big shift for call of duty because again the the the this this is called you eat medal of honor serve thing was like it it had its origin did that like you know realistic

somewhat realistic if historical type thing but it also took military shooters and brought it to the level of a halo yeah run in so it yet basic and so modern warfare arm you know that really was the think that kind of like established not only the the genre is been received sort world beater that it is now but ourselves that particular

i'm frank i'm sort of experience i'd also like to point out the i play the single player campaign three times on three different i just played it and then i'd rather of the difficult to hide and in a rapper i don't know it's there was just something about that game i think for whatever reason it just resonate with me also but although the interesting thing here is that titan fall either

really this and this information was out there but i don't really realize it will just recently he doesn't have accepted right follows a multiplayer only get in fact me to stop the review copies of our plants vs zombies garden warfare also for he i also breaks explicitly on x box he has his arm and that to we say is a multiplayer mode checkbox light bulb wired

we've been listed a hodge ray of of audio experts in the office we we borrowed mike's you had outside people come in your hands of friends you're trying to fix this ah so hopefully this visit yes they're was when i'm looking there were there was a level prop my speak nobody could hear any of us reason most the all ah yeah i thought that

spear arm which is interesting as i played the the first thing you do with tight followers he played it before it yeah i'm it walks you through to get and for a half an hour i'm thing is teaches you all of the basics of movement shooting at getting to tight with student at which is nice about three times as long as your usual training story on level anyhow it's extensive research yeah and i really

and i kind of the i found myself i wish there was a single player adventure because it's almost they mean it's it's mirrors edgy in terms of scroll the have how how fast you run you can double jump you can all while ron you could jump between walls it's like this actually feel pretty good as a first person have flat for me highly game but unfortunately

that's not reflected in day how he actually structured elaborate are because they are multiplayer ah nuts literacy they are they are online is whole game and you know if it some i'm sure this it reaches out that hope your split screen i don't know if there is it off that's a good question i don't yeah i don't i don't know either that or his book he should have lost

so as far as gameplay goes i'm you know i certainly enjoyed myself i think that what's nice about it is being a more star future let's say version of it says he or she said it takes elements of halo in in your kind of secret you qualities a wall double jumps the wall runs you just you feel a lot more like a spartan then you do

military operative on planets arms and because of that ah it it makes the there's also another element of of he will play you is this kind of whose mission extraction so yeah if you're playing the attrition model which is their version of a team that match on are you a certain point thresholds for killed rational once that's done the losing team

has to get to an extraction point get picked up and get out and artist of score way of the rams that i played it seem like from one to three people would make the extraction yeah yeah we'll can even tried as she tells them and right and that is why wanted you keep we only got blown up once there was once we were up against a see that really had kind of dominated us knew what they were doing and i got the drop shipping out of the extraction

point all like they were or of the opposite team stay we're all in titans and they were all i ring on the ship simultaneous that ship he took get the whole ship yeah oh or option that's all i did not see that have you that anybody i think you have to like you really have to concentrate heavy weapons fire on for a while to do

so you bring this up there's there's see you really interesting things and growing number one i really like how they they basically store a fight multiplayer is like typically you know i don't give a lot of multiplayer first person shooter and but like the match starts and you just be good totally there is no reason why you're on the battlefield your and mill valley

that even on the battlefield yeah you're the drops in as you think so it mostly you start middle mouse allies in most it that in in other games you know they went on the battle ends ever this breezes is at the flick of the game is up so number one from of who had of aesthetic standpoint this game begins with you in a drop ship you jump out of the drop ship and then you're in the so there's like a a compelling

the reason for why this battle was getting have nowhere is or soldier you're going up that's why you're starting this battle now everything's going on around you you fight the battle and then it doesn't just abruptly and says were you know where did the old drop ships comedy and all survivors get to drop shipping he get out and so then then there's a storyline reason for why the battle is in that point one point

i don't either i just couldn't find high my computer that's that's days i blamed myself yeah exactly see i'm going to pick the he could happen now i'd imagine glory home fast forwarding through podcast everything else that anyone else said to try to get i got name has but i be myself to see you can be myself to it ah my preschooler i the editor of game like

she you every single time every single battle that i played i lost i did not wins me the during his hired hate paul battle mighty never won a bad now of course the out the he you might point out that the one constant the everything that i was on his me that but the city have you are the bane of other video the highway safety

work he's no moments where i was not the worst person i'm so but we never won but i always had a wax because even in defeat there was element of you could you could win defeat or lose defeat yeah because if you after your defeated manage to run to the drop ship and get yourself onto the drops yet without dying and and blast

off you get a bunch of map boatload of experience points for haven't done that he ended you feel really good about sets you actually feel good yeah i type i did yeah that's absolutely true i yeah yes there's the a moment when you get on as i will i never thought about myself as having lost if i was able to get up the drop ship and also you get on the drop ship depending on how earlier there you are

you are other enemy soldiers coming up and try to take what while you're in dropped a you have to be fire on them from with it from the safety of the drop ship better and then there's more so the and then the other quick element to that to that epilogue section is once the round has been cut announced over you get to the drop ship did you killed at that point there's no response let's get killed at the beginning of that epilogue fashion you just have to sit there and just factory and it so much more

rating than just being killed and getting kicked out to the lobby yeah jack are these i could be having more common after watching other people have yeah yeah yeah i'm so a couple quick notes on type of that i enjoyed i'm in particular were ah i like that so there there's kind of it to tear game you play soldier in and can get in a mac he on his titan and play in the type each a

as class so obviously there soldier yeah classes the he played country darn close quarters combat or been sassy or what have you and then your titans can also calibrated two different types of gameplay and i enjoy that aspect of finding a titan class that wasn't the exact same play styles my soldier class with than being able to do both be more of a tank as a titan the been more a rope around

the people asylum sort so i enjoyed that cut melting play styles i also really enjoyed some the weaponry he particular there's a smart pistol that you use has an auto lock feature yeah which makes it feel much more like a primary weapon and or any other is either use yeah yeah real issue am i didn't play enough to level up enough within the classes he was scope so i played iron sights only essentially for all the way

that are you so i can't really speak to them mathewson weapons on which is always a big draw the shooter but there are so many other elements this game that i don't think that that would be as much of a compelling yea or nay i'm certainly the the cut acrobatic superhero nature of of the run dinosaurs gavel bangs yeah yeah without you i i don't

well at first person shooters having played the title for me that over the see that changing for me like playing it was like oh that's right this is why i don't play this just isn't i'm but the same time it really it it was more fun i think that i've ever had with a multiplayer shooter it's is did they have correctly reese thought how do we make this point it's your time

how do we make you feel like publishing something even yes i mean like it was really great like after getting blown up in a titan so many times like thirty seconds after i get in there was it was really fun when i was able to stick around in a titan for a little bit longer by judicious running away recharging shields coming back doing some damage eating and then you know as of the will you know exceeded
